Using `BurnySc2/python-sc2` is like being handed a key to one of the most complex real-time strategy environments ever created. Your code becomes the brain of a player, and the possibilities extend far beyond just "making a bot."

Think of your journey as a ladder. Each rung represents a more complex project that builds on the skills you learned from the previous one.

Let's break down what you can build at each stage.

---

#### **Stage 1: Specialized Tools & Analyzers**

Before building a full player, it's incredibly useful to learn the API by creating small, focused tools. These projects are simple and teach you how to read the game's state without worrying about complex decision-making.

| Project Type | **Goal:** What you're trying to do. | **Key `python-sc2` Concepts:** | **Skills Gained:** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Observation Bot** | Read and print game information to the console. | `self.state`, `self.units`, `self.structures` | Accessing game data, using the game loop (`on_step`). |
| **Mechanics Trainer** | Create specific scenarios for a human to practice against. | `self.do()`, `unit.attack(position)` | Issuing basic commands, precise unit control. |
| **Data Analyzer** | Run a simulation and log the results to a file. | `unit.health`, `self.time` | Data collection, understanding combat outcomes. |

**✅ Project Idea Checklist:**
- [ ] Make a bot that prints your starting mineral and vespene count every 10 seconds.
- [ ] Create a bot that spawns 10 Zerglings and sends them to attack a single point on the map.
- [ ] Build a script that only builds Supply Depots (or Pylons/Overlords) until you run out of money.

#### **Stage 2: The "Clockwork" Bot**

This is your first *real* bot. Its strength comes from executing a single, perfectly timed strategy (a "build order") without deviation. It won't react to the enemy, but it will teach you all the fundamental mechanics of managing an autonomous player.

| Project Type | **Goal:** What you're trying to do. | **Key `python-sc2` Concepts:** | **Skills Gained:** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Build Order Bot** | Flawlessly execute a build from start to finish. | `self.can_afford()`, `self.train()`, `worker.build()` | Resource management, production queuing. |
| **Early-Game Rusher** | Build an army quickly and attack the enemy base. | `self.enemy_start_locations`, `units.attack()` | Basic state management (e.g., "am I attacking?"). |

**✅ Project Idea Checklist:**
- [ ] Build a "4-Gate" Protoss bot that builds 4 Gateways and attacks with Zealots.
- [ ] Create a Zerg bot that does a "6-Pool" rush, training Zerglings as fast as possible.
- [ ] Make a Terran bot that builds a Barracks, then a Factory, then a Starport, creating one of each unit type.

#### **Stage 3: The Strategic, Reactive Bot**

This is where true intelligence begins. Your bot will now use the information it gathers to make decisions. It will scout, analyze the enemy, and adapt its strategy in real-time. This is the most common and rewarding type of bot to build.

| Project Type | **Goal:** What you're trying to do. | **Key `python-sc2` Concepts:** | **Skills Gained:** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Scouting Bot** | Send a worker to the enemy base to see what they are building. | `self.enemy_units`, `unit.is_idle`, `unit.move()` | Information gathering, conditional logic (`if`/`else`). |
| **Adaptive Bot**| Change its build order based on what it scouts. | `unit.type_id`, `self.structures.exists` | Complex state machines, mid-game planning. |
| **Micro-Intensive Bot**| Control units precisely in combat (e.g., stutter-stepping).| `unit.weapon_cooldown`, ability-specific commands.| Fine-grained unit control, event-driven actions. |

**✅ Project Idea Checklist:**
- [ ] If your scouting worker sees the enemy is building air units, build anti-air units in response.
- [ ] If you have more than 5 idle workers, command them to gather minerals.
- [ ] Make your ranged units attack and move backward if an enemy gets too close.

#### **Stage 4: The Competitive, Learning AI**

This is the frontier of bot development. These projects often involve advanced AI concepts, including machine learning, to create bots that can learn from their games and improve over time.

| Project Type | **Goal:** What you're trying to do. | **Key `python-sc2` Concepts:** | **Skills Gained:** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data-Driven Bot** | Save data from games and use it to inform future strategy. | File I/O (reading/writing to disk) | Data persistence, basic statistical analysis. |
| **ML-Integrated Bot**| Use a machine learning model to make high-level decisions.| Integration with libraries like TensorFlow/PyTorch.| Machine learning principles, API integration. |

**✅ Project Idea Checklist:**
- [ ] Save the result (win/loss) of every match along with the build order you used.
- [ ] Create a bot that tries a random strategy, and over time, learns to prefer the ones that lead to more wins.
