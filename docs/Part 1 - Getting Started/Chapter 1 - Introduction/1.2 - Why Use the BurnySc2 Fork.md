For any developer entering the StarCraft II AI scene today, the choice of library is simple: **`BurnySc2/python-sc2` is the only actively maintained and community-supported option.** The original `Dentosal/python-sc2` library should be considered archived and is unsuitable for new projects.

This chapter will clarify precisely why the `BurnySc2` fork is the correct and necessary choice for modern bot development.

#### **Project Setup Checklist**

To ensure your project is aligned with current community standards and will function correctly, follow this checklist.

*   [x] Use Python 3.8 or newer.
*   [x] Install the `burnysc2` package from PyPI (`pip install burnysc2`).
*   [x] Base your project on `BurnySc2` examples and documentation.
*   [ ] Do **not** install the old `sc2` package.
*   [ ] Do **not** use documentation or tutorials referencing the `Dentosal` fork without verifying the code.

#### **Direct Comparison: `Dentosal` vs. `BurnySc2`**

The decision becomes clear when we compare the two projects directly. The `BurnySc2` fork provides critical updates for stability, performance, and modern Python compatibility.

| Feature | `Dentosal/python-sc2` (Original) | `BurnySc2/python-sc2` (Current Standard) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Project Status** | **Inactive.** Archived since late 2019. | **Active.** Regularly updated and maintained. |
| **Python Version** | Relies on older versions (e.g., Python 3.7). | Compatible with modern Python (3.8+). |
| **Bug Fixes** | Contains known, unfixed bugs. | Fixes critical issues (e.g., worker management, API parsing). |
| **Performance** | Less optimized. | Includes performance enhancements like `bot.do_actions()` for faster command execution. |
| **Community** | No longer supported by the community. | The official choice for AI Arena and the developer Discord. |
| **Documentation** | Outdated. | Documentation is kept current with the library's features. |

#### **Project Lineage: A Visual History**

The relationship between the forks shows a clear path of succession. The community's development efforts have fully transitioned away from the original project.

#### **Final Verdict: A Critical Assessment**

**Critique:** Attempting to build a bot on the original `Dentosal/python-sc2` library in 2025 is an exercise in futility. A developer would immediately encounter:
1.  **Dependency Failures:** The library may not install correctly with modern versions of Python and its dependencies.
2.  **Unfixed Bugs:** Critical bugs, such as those related to unit tracking or game state parsing, would require the developer to patch the library themselves.
3.  **Community Isolation:** There would be no support from the community, as all active members have migrated to the `BurnySc2` fork. Any questions would be met with the same advice: "Switch to `BurnySc2`."

**Improvement:** The `BurnySc2` fork resolves all of these issues. It is not merely an alternative; it is the functional successor to the original project. By providing a stable, performant, and supported foundation, it allows a developer to focus on what truly matters: **building a smart and competitive bot.** Choosing `BurnySc2` is the first and most important step in setting a project up for success.
