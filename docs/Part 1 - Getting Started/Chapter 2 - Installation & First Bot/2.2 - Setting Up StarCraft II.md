For your bot to run, it needs two components: the StarCraft II game itself and the specific map files used by the bot-development community. This guide will walk you through installing both and, more importantly, explain *why* we do it this way.

#### **Setup Checklist**

-   [ ] **Task 1:** Install the free StarCraft II game client.
-   [ ] **Task 2:** Understand the community's solution to game versioning.
-   [ ] **Task 3:** Download the required community map packs using the built-in tool.
-   [ ] **Task 4:** Verify that the maps are correctly installed.

#### **Step 1: Install the StarCraft II Game Client**

Your bot is an AI player that operates inside the actual game, so you need it on your system.

| Action | Instructions | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Get Battle.net** | Download and install the [Battle.net Client](https://www.blizzard.com/en-us/apps/battle.net/desktop). | This is Blizzard's official game launcher. |
| **2. Install SC2** | In the Battle.net client, find StarCraft II and click "Install". | The **free Starter Edition** is all you need. You do not need to purchase the game. |
| **3. Location** | Install the game to the default directory. | `python-sc2` will automatically find the game if it's in the standard location. |

#### **Step 2: Install the Community Map Packs**

This is the most critical part of the setup. We don't use the standard maps from the live game. Instead, we use specific maps to ensure stability and fair competition.

**The Problem:** Newer StarCraft II versions can be unstable for bots, causing "desync" errors where players see different game states. Blizzard also stopped releasing Linux versions of the game client.

**The Solution:** The community has adopted a clever standard to solve this.

```
  [ Stable Game Client (e.g., v4.10) ] --- Provides a reliable, non-desyncing engine.
               +
  [  Custom "AIE" Map Files        ] --- Injects modern unit balance into the old engine.
               ||
  [================================]
  [ A Stable, Modern Gameplay Env. ] --- This is our target setup.
```

We use an older, stable version of the game, and then use special maps (often ending in "AIE" for AI Edition) that contain the latest balance updates.

**Installation To-Do List:**

1.  **Activate your virtual environment** if it isn't already.
    *   `(venv)` should be visible in your terminal prompt.

2.  **Run the built-in `burnysc2` map downloader.** This command handles everything for you.
    ```sh
    python -m sc2.maps --download_all
    ```
    This script automatically finds your StarCraft II installation, downloads the correct map packs, and places them in the `Maps` folder.

#### **Step 3: Verify the Map Installation**

A good developer always verifies their work. Let's make sure the maps are where they should be.

1.  **Navigate to your StarCraft II installation directory.**
    *   **Default Windows:** `C:\Program Files (x86)\StarCraft II`
    *   **Default macOS:** `/Applications/StarCraft II`

2.  **Look for a `Maps` folder.** Inside it, you should now see sub-folders for the map packs you downloaded.

**Verification Checklist:**
- [ ] Does the `StarCraft II/Maps` directory exist?
- [ ] Inside `Maps`, do you see folders with names like `Ladder2019Season2AIE`, `Ladder2023Season1AIE`, or similar?

If you can see these folders, your game environment is now correctly set up and ready for you to run your first bot.
