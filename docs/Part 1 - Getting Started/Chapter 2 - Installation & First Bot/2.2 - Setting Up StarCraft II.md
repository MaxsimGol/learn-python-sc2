### **2.2. Setting Up the Game Environment**

For your bot to run, it needs two components: the StarCraft II game itself and the specific map files used by the bot-development community. This guide will walk you through installing both and, more importantly, explain *why* we do it this way.

#### **Setup Checklist**

-   [ ] **Task 1:** Install the free StarCraft II game client.
-   [ ] **Task 2:** Understand the community's solution to game versioning.
-   [ ] **Task 3:** Manually download and install the required community map packs.

#### **Step 1: Install the StarCraft II Game Client**

Your bot is an AI player that operates inside the actual game, so you need it on your system.

| Action | Instructions | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Get Battle.net** | Download and install the [Battle.net Client](https://www.blizzard.com/en-us/apps/battle.net/desktop). | This is Blizzard's official game launcher. |
| **2. Install SC2** | In the Battle.net client, find StarCraft II and click "Install". | The **free Starter Edition** is all you need. You do not need to purchase the game. |
| **3. Location** | Install the game to the default directory. | `python-sc2` will automatically find the game if it's in the standard location. |

#### **Step 2: Manually Install the Community Map Packs**

This is the most critical part of the setup. **There is no automatic downloader.** You must manually download and place the map files. We don't use the standard maps from the live game; instead, we use specific maps to ensure stability and fair competition.

**The Problem:** Newer StarCraft II versions can be unstable for bots, causing "desync" errors where players see different game states. Blizzard also stopped releasing Linux versions of the game client.

**The Solution:** The community has adopted a clever standard to solve this.

```
  [ Stable Game Client (e.g., v4.10) ] --- Provides a reliable, non-desyncing engine.
               +
  [  Custom "AIE" Map Files        ] --- Injects modern unit balance into the old engine.
               ||
  [================================]
  [ A Stable, Modern Gameplay Env. ] --- This is our target setup.
```

**Installation To-Do List:**

1.  **Navigate to the Map Repository:** Open your web browser and go to the official StarCraft II client protocol repository's map section:
    *   **[https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-proto#map-packs](https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-proto#map-packs)**

2.  **Download the Map Packs:** Download the `.zip` files for the map packs. It is recommended to download the packs that include "AIE" maps (e.g., `Ladder2017Season1AIE.zip`) you can choose any option you want, but you'll need to change get("Name_your_map").
3.  **Find Your StarCraft II Installation Directory:**
    *   **Default Windows:** `C:\Program Files (x86)\StarCraft II`
    *   **Default macOS:** `/Applications/StarCraft II`

4.  **Create the `Maps` Folder:** Inside the main `StarCraft II` directory, you must **manually create a new folder** named `Maps` if it does not already exist.

5.  **Unzip the Maps:** Extract the contents of the `.zip` files you downloaded directly into the `StarCraft II/Maps` folder. The files are password protected with the password 'iagreetotheeula'.
