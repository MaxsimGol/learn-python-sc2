This chapter will guide you through setting up your development environment and installing the `burnysc2` library. Following these steps will ensure you have a clean, isolated, and verifiable setup, which is the professional standard for any software project.

#### **Installation Checklist**

-   [ ] **Task 1:** Verify your system meets the project requirements.
-   [ ] **Task 2:** Create an isolated virtual environment for your bot.
-   [ ] **Task 3:** Install the `burnysc2` library into that environment.
-   [ ] **Task 4:** Confirm that the installation was successful.

#### **Step 1: System Requirements**

Before we install anything, let's ensure your system is ready.

| Component | Requirement | Where to Get It | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Python** | Version 3.10 or newer | [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) | `burnysc2` requires modern asynchronous features. |
| **StarCraft II** | Any version | [Battle.net Client](https://www.blizzard.com/en-us/apps/battle.net/desktop) | The free Starter Edition is all you need. |
| **Map Files**| Required for bots | [Community GitHub](https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-proto#map-packs) | Download and place the maps in your `StarCraft II/Maps` directory. |

#### **Step 2: The Installation Process**

We will install the library in a **virtual environment**. Think of this as a clean, private workspace for your project, preventing it from interfering with other Python projects on your computer. This is not optional; it is the correct way to manage project dependencies.

**The Concept:**
```
Your Computer
|
+-- Global Python (Avoid installing here!)
|
+-- Your_Bot_Project/
    |
    +-- venv/ (Your project's private, isolated workspace)
        |
        +-- Python Interpreter
        +-- pip
        +-- burnysc2 (Library is installed here)
```

**Installation To-Do List:**

1.  **Create a folder for your project.** Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate into it.
    ```sh
    mkdir my-sc2-bot
    cd my-sc2-bot
    ```

2.  **Create the virtual environment.** We will name it `venv`.
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the environment.** This tells your terminal to use this private workspace.
    *   **On Windows:**
        ```sh
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    *   **On macOS and Linux:**
        ```sh
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    *(Your terminal prompt should now show `(venv)` at the beginning.)*

4.  **Install `burnysc2`.** Now that your environment is active, use `pip` to install the library. The `--upgrade` flag ensures you get the latest version.
    ```sh
    pip install --upgrade burnysc2
    ```

#### **Step 3: Verifying Your Installation**

Finally, let's verify that the library was installed correctly inside your active environment.

Run the following command:
```sh
pip show burnysc2
```

You should see output that confirms the installation details. This is your proof that everything is ready for the next step.

**Example Output:**
```
