In programming, a "Hello, World!" application is the simplest possible program that proves a new system is working. Our goal here is the same: we will build a bot that does nothing in-game but prints messages to your console.

This exercise will teach you the fundamental structure and lifecycle of every bot you will build from now on.

#### **Chapter Checklist**

-   [ ] **Task 1:** Create the Python file for the `HelloBot`.
-   [ ] **Task 2:** Understand the bot's lifecycle diagram.
-   [ ] **Task 3:** Run the bot and observe the output.
-   [ ] **Task 4:** Verify that the bot completes its full lifecycle.

#### **The Bot's Lifecycle**

Every `python-sc2` bot follows a simple, predictable lifecycle. Understanding this flow is the key to knowing where to place your code.

```
(Game Starts)
      |
      v
[ on_start() ]  <-- Runs ONCE at the beginning for setup.
      |
      |--------------------------.
      |                          |
      v                          | (Loop)
[ on_step() ]   <-- Runs REPEATEDLY, many times per second.
      |                          |
      '--------------------------'
      |
      v
[ on_end() ]    <-- Runs ONCE after the game has finished.
      |
      v
(Game Ends)
```

#### **Step 1: The Code**

Create a new file named `hello_bot.py` and paste the following code into it.

```python
# hello_bot.py

from sc2 import main
from sc2.bot_ai import BotAI
from sc2.data import Difficulty, Result, Race
from sc2.player import Bot, Computer
from sc2.maps import get


class HelloBot(BotAI):
    """A bot to demonstrate the fundamental lifecycle."""

    async def on_start(self):
        """Runs once, at the start of the game."""
        print("Lifecycle: on_start() - Game has begun!")

    async def on_step(self, iteration: int):
        """Runs on every game step (frame)."""
        if iteration % 200 == 0:
            # Print a message every 200 steps to show this is looping.
            print(f"Lifecycle: on_step() - Iteration: {iteration}")

    async def on_end(self, game_result: Result):
        """Runs once, after the game is over."""
        print("Lifecycle: on_end() - Game has finished!")
        print(f"The game result was: {game_result}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main.run_game(
        get("AbyssalReefLE"),
        [
            Bot(Race.Terran, HelloBot()),
            Computer(Race.Zerg, Difficulty.Hard),  # Add an AI to ensure the game ends.
        ],
        realtime=False,  # Run as fast as possible.
        save_replay_as="HelloBotReplay.SC2Replay",
    )

```

#### **Step 2: Anatomy of the Bot**

This code has two main parts: the bot's "brain" (the `HelloBot` class) and the "launcher" (`main.run_game`). Let's dissect the brain.

| Component | Code | Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Bot Class** | `class HelloBot(BotAI):` | This is the blueprint for your bot. It inherits all the core capabilities from the library's `BotAI` class. |
| **The Setup Method**| `async def on_start(self):` | This is your bot's constructor. It's the perfect place for setup logic that only needs to run once. |
| **The Main Loop** | `async def on_step(self, ...):` | This is the heart of the bot. Almost all your decision-making logic (to build, fight, or expand) will live here. |
| **The Cleanup Method**|`async def on_end(self, ...):`| This is your bot's destructor. It's ideal for post-game analysis or saving learned data. The `game_result` tells you if you won or lost.|

#### **Step 3: Execution and Verification**

1.  **Activate your virtual environment.** `(venv)`
2.  **Run the script from your terminal.**
    ```sh
    python hello_bot.py
    ```

**Expected Outcome:**

Because we set `realtime=False` and added an opponent, the game will run very quickly and you won't see much on screen. The important part is the output in your **terminal**. You will see messages appear in a specific order, proving the lifecycle works as expected.

```
Lifecycle: on_start() - Game has begun!
Lifecycle: on_step() - Iteration: 0
Lifecycle: on_step() - Iteration: 200
Lifecycle: on_step() - Iteration: 400
...
Lifecycle: on_end() - Game has finished!
The game result was: Result.Victory
```

Congratulations. You have successfully created a bot and verified its core execution lifecycle. You are now ready to add actions inside this structure.
