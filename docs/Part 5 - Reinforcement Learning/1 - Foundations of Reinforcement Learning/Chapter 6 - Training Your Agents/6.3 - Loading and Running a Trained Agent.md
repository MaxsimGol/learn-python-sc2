Training a model is only half the process. Once you have a trained agent saved to a file, you need a way to load and run it for evaluation, a process known as **inference**. This allows you to watch your agent perform, test its capabilities against specific opponents, and verify its learned policy without the overhead of retraining.

This section provides a dedicated, reusable script for running inference on your saved models.

#### **The Inference Workflow**

Unlike the training loop, the inference loop does not learn or update the model. It simply uses the model's existing policy to choose actions.

```
+--------------------------+
| 1. Select & Load Model   |
+--------------------------+
             |
             v
+--------------------------+
| 2. Reset Environment     |
+--------------------------+
             |
             v
+--------------------------+
| 3. Get Observation       |
+--------------------------+
             |
             |       +-------------------+
             |       | 4. Predict Action |
             +------>|   (model.predict) |
                     +-------------------+
             <------+
             |
             | 5. Step Environment
             |
             v
+--------------------------+
| 6. Repeat until Done     |
+--------------------------+
```

#### **Using the Learned Policy- `model.predict()`**

The core of the inference loop is the `model.predict()` method.

| Parameter | Value | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `deterministic` | `True` | **(For Evaluation)** Instructs the model to always choose the action with the highest probability. This reflects the agent's "true" learned policy and makes its behavior consistent. |
| `deterministic` | `False` | **(For Training)** Allows the model to sample from its action probabilities. This encourages exploration, which is necessary for learning but not for evaluation. |

#### **Code- The Reusable `run_agent.py` Script**

This script is your entry point for evaluating any of the agents you have trained.

```python
# run_agent.py

import multiprocessing as mp
import time

from stable_baselines3 import PPO

# Import all possible environments
from worker_bot import WorkerEnv
from macro_bot import MacroEnv
from micro_bot import MicroEnv

# --- Configuration ---
# Use a dictionary to map names to environment classes and model paths.
AGENT_CONFIG = {
    "worker": {
        "env": WorkerEnv,
        "path": "./models/ppo_sc2_worker.zip"
    },
    "macro": {
        "env": MacroEnv,
        "path": "./models/ppo_sc2_macro.zip"
    },
    "micro": {
        "env": MicroEnv,
        "path": "./models/ppo_sc2_micro.zip"
    }
}
# CHANGE THIS VALUE to select which agent to run
SELECTED_AGENT = "micro"

def main():
    """Loads and runs a pre-trained agent for one episode."""
    
    config = AGENT_CONFIG[SELECTED_AGENT]
    print(f"--- Running evaluation for agent: {SELECTED_AGENT.upper()} ---")

    # --- Step 1: Instantiate the Environment ---
    env = config["env"]()

    # --- Step 2: Load the Trained Model ---
    try:
        model = PPO.load(config["path"])
        print(f"Model loaded successfully from: {config['path']}")
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"ERROR: Model file not found at {config['path']}")
        print("Please run a training script to train and save the model first.")
        env.close()
        return

    # --- Step 3: Run the Inference Loop ---
    obs, info = env.reset()
    terminated = False
    truncated = False

    while not (terminated or truncated):
        # Use the model to predict the next action.
        # deterministic=True ensures the agent plays its best learned policy.
        action, _states = model.predict(obs, deterministic=True)
        
        # Take the action in the environment.
        obs, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action)
        
        # Optional: Add a small delay to make it easier to watch.
        time.sleep(0.01)

    if truncated:
        print("Episode finished due to reaching a limit (truncated).")
    else:
        print("Episode finished normally (terminated).")
    
    # --- Final Step: Clean up ---
    env.close()


if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Add the multiprocessing guard for Windows compatibility when creating executables.
    mp.freeze_support()
    main()
