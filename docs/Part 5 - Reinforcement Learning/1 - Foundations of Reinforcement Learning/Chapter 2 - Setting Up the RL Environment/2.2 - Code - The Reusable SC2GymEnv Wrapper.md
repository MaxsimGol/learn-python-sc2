This file provides the complete, reusable implementation of the `SC2GymEnv` class. This class is the architectural cornerstone of our project, acting as the adapter that allows the synchronous `stable-baselines3` library to communicate with the asynchronous `python-sc2` game engine.

Save this code as `sc2_gym_env.py`. It will serve as the base class for all specific RL environments we create.

#### **Class Responsibilities**

*   [x] **API Adherence:** Implements the standard `gymnasium.Env` interface.
*   [x] **Process Management:** Manages the lifecycle of the `python-sc2` game process, including startup and cleanup.
*   [x] **Communication Bridge:** Orchestrates the flow of actions and observations between the two processes using `multiprocessing` queues.
