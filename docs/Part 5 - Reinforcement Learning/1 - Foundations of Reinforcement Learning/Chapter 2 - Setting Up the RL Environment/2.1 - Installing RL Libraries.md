*Key Changes: This revision elevates the documentation from a simple list of commands to a professional setup guide. It introduces a "Project Dependencies" table to clearly define the role of each library, providing essential context for a developer. The installation process is framed as a formal "Setup Workflow" checklist, and a crucial note about PyTorch as the deep learning backend has been added. The verification step is also made more robust by including the library versions, which is a standard practice for ensuring a reproducible environment.*

### **2.1 - Installing RL Libraries**

To build and train a learning agent, our project requires several key libraries from the Python scientific computing ecosystem. This section outlines the dependencies and provides a step-by-step workflow for setting up a clean, isolated development environment.

#### **Project Dependencies**

Our implementation will rely on the following core packages:

| Library | Role |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`gymnasium`** | The modern standard for defining Reinforcement Learning environments. It provides the API contract our `SC2GymEnv` wrapper will adhere to. |
| **`stable-baselines3`** | A high-performance library of pre-implemented RL algorithms (like PPO). This will serve as the "brain" or **Agent**. |
| **`torch`** | The deep learning framework used by `stable-baselines3` to define and train the neural network models. |
| **`tensorboard`** | A visualization toolkit for inspecting the training process, allowing us to graph rewards and other metrics. |

#### **Setup Workflow**

The installation is a three-step process designed to ensure a stable and reproducible environment.

*   [x] **Step 1:** Create and activate a dedicated virtual environment.
*   [x] **Step 2:** Install the required packages via `pip`.
*   [x] **Step 3:** Verify the installation and library versions.

#### **Step 1 - Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**

This is a critical best practice to prevent dependency conflicts.

1.  **Navigate to your project folder** in your terminal.
2.  **Create the environment** (e.g., named `venv`):
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    ```
3.  **Activate it**:
    *   **Windows (Command Prompt / PowerShell):**
        ```sh
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    *   **macOS / Linux:**
        ```sh
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

---

#### **Step 2 - Install Libraries via `pip`**

With the virtual environment active, a single command will install all necessary packages.

```sh
pip install "stable-baselines3[extra]>=2.0.0"
```

*   **Why this command?**
    *   `stable-baselines3`: Installs the core library.
    *   `[extra]`: This is a crucial addition. It automatically pulls in `gymnasium`, `torch`, and `tensorboard`, satisfying all our dependencies in one step.
    *   `>=2.0.0`: Specifies a minimum version to ensure API compatibility.

---

#### **Step 3 - Verify Installation**

Confirm that all packages were installed correctly and check their versions.

1.  In your active terminal, start a Python interpreter by typing `python`.
2.  At the Python prompt (`>>>`), run the following code:

    ```python
    try:
        import gymnasium
        import stable_baselines3
        import torch

        print("--- Verification Successful ---")
        print(f"gymnasium version: {gymnasium.__version__}")
        print(f"stable-baselines3 version: {stable_baselines3.__version__}")
        print(f"torch version: {torch.__version__}")
        print("-----------------------------")

    except ImportError as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
        print("Please check your installation.")

    ```If you see the version numbers without any errors, your environment is correctly configured, and you are ready to implement the `SC2GymEnv` wrapper.
