Having successfully trained an agent on a single task, we now introduce a core element of strategy games: **decision-making under constraints**. Our second agent will learn to manage the fundamental economic trade-off between building more **workers** (increasing income) and building more **supply** (increasing capacity).

This task is designed to teach the agent to prioritize actions based on a dynamic game state, moving beyond a single, repetitive goal.

#### **The Conceptual Challenge- Balancing Competing Goods**

The agent must learn that both actions are "good" but that one is often more critical than the other depending on the situation.

```
+------------------------+      +-----------------------------+
|   Action 1: Build SCV  |      |  Action 2: Build Depot      |
+------------------------+      +-----------------------------+
|        PROS:           |      |          PROS:              |
|  + Increases Income    |      |  + Unlocks Army Growth      |
|        CONS:           |      |          CONS:              |
|  - Consumes Supply     |      |  - Does not increase Income |
|                        |      |                             |
+-----------^------------+      +-------------^---------------+
            |                                |
            |      WHICH ONE IS BETTER       |
            |          RIGHT NOW?            |
            +--------------------------------+
                          |
            +-------------v---------------+
            |      The Agent's Policy     |
            +-----------------------------+
```

#### **Success Criteria**

*   [x] The agent must learn to continuously produce workers.
*   [x] The agent must learn to proactively build Supply Depots to avoid being supply-blocked.
*   [x] The agent must learn to prioritize depot construction when `supply_left` is low, even if it has enough minerals to build a worker.
*   [x] The episode must terminate successfully upon reaching a target of 30 workers.

#### **Environment Design**

**1. Observation Space Specification**

To make an informed decision, the agent now needs full visibility into the supply situation.

*   **Gymnasium Type:** `gymnasium.spaces.Box`
*   **Shape:** `(4,)`
*   **Data Type:** `numpy.float32`

| Index | Source Feature | Normalization | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `0` | `self.minerals` | `1000.0` | "Can I afford my chosen action?" |
| `1` | `self.workers.amount`| `50.0` | "How is my economic progress?" |
| `2` | `self.supply_used` | `200.0`| "How much pressure is on my supply?" |
| `3` | `self.supply_cap` | `200.0`| "What is my current supply limit?" |

---

**2. Action Space Specification**

The action space is expanded to allow for the new building choice.

*   **Gymnasium Type:** `gymnasium.spaces.Discrete`
*   **Size:** `3`

| Action Value | Agent's Intent |
| :--- | :--- |
| `0` | Do Nothing |
| `1` | Build Worker (SCV) |
| `2` | Build Supply (Supply Depot) |

---

**3. Reward Function Specification**

The reward function is designed to heavily punish the primary failure state (getting supply-blocked) while lightly encouraging all productive actions.

**Pseudocode Logic:**
```
function get_reward(action, game_state, last_supply_left):
  reward = 0

  # Event-Based Penalty for a critical failure
  if game_state.supply_left == 0 and last_supply_left > 0:
    reward -= 10

  # Sparse Rewards for productive actions
  if action == 1 and successfully_trained_worker:
    reward += 1
  elif action == 2 and successfully_built_depot:
    reward += 2 // Slightly higher to incentivize this crucial task

  return reward
```

This design forces the agent to develop a more sophisticated policy. It cannot simply learn to always build workers; it must learn to pay attention to its supply and act preemptively to avoid the large penalty.
