This file contains the complete implementation of the `MacroEnv`. It builds directly upon the concepts from the `WorkerBot` but expands the agent's capabilities to include managing supply, forcing it to learn a more complex economic policy.

This code translates the design specification from the preceding sections into a functional `gymnasium` environment.

#### **Implementation Checklist**

*   [x] **`MacroBot` (`BotAI` subclass):**
    *   [x] Handles a new action (`action == 2`) for building Supply Depots.
    *   [x] Implements the event-based penalty for becoming supply-blocked by tracking the previous step's supply state.
    *   [x] Provides the new, expanded 4-feature observation vector.
    *   [x] Updates the termination condition to a higher worker count (30).
*   [x] **`MacroEnv` (`gymnasium.Env` subclass):**
    *   [x] Defines the expanded `action_space` as `Discrete(3)`.
    *   [x] Defines the expanded `observation_space` as a `Box` with a shape of `(4,)`.
