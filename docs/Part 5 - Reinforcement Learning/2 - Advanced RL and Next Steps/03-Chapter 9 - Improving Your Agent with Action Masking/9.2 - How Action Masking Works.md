Action Masking is an architectural pattern that solves the Invalid Action Problem by injecting domain knowledge directly into the agent's decision-making process. Instead of letting the agent explore the entire theoretical action space, the environment provides a "mask" on each step that restricts the agent's choices to only those that are currently valid.

#### **The Core Concept- Pre-filtering, Not Post-correction**

The mask is not used to correct an agent's mistake. Rather, it is provided *as part of the observation*, allowing the agent's policy network to completely ignore invalid actions from the outset.

#### **The Right Tool- `sb3-contrib` and `MaskablePPO`**

The `stable-baselines3` ecosystem provides a purpose-built solution for this in the `sb3-contrib` package.

*   **`sb3-contrib`:** A companion library with experimental and advanced algorithms.
*   **`MaskablePPO`:** A version of PPO specifically designed to accept and utilize an action mask during training. Using this is the standard, best-practice approach.

#### **Architectural Changes Required**

Implementing action masking requires a specific modification to the environment's API and the data flow between the environment and the agent.

| Component | "Before" (No Masking) | "After" (With Masking) | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Observation Space** | `gym.spaces.Box` | `gym.spaces.Dict` | The observation must now be a dictionary containing both the original state and the action mask. |
| **Observation Data** | A single `numpy.ndarray` | A dictionary: `{"obs": ndarray, "action_mask": ndarray}` | The dictionary structure is the standard way to pass multiple, distinct pieces of information to the agent. |
| **RL Algorithm** | `stable_baselines3.PPO` | `sb3_contrib.MaskablePPO` | `MaskablePPO` is specifically designed to parse the dictionary observation and use the `"action_mask"` key to constrain its policy output. |

#### **The Action Masking Workflow**

This diagram illustrates the new data flow with action masking implemented.

```
+--------------------------+
|  1. Environment State    |
| (Game Step N)            |
+--------------------------+
             |
             +----------------------------------+
             |                                  |
             v                                  v
+--------------------------+     +--------------------------+
|  2. Generate State Obs   |     |  3. Generate Action Mask |
| (The unit feature matrix)|     | (The boolean vector)     |
+--------------------------+     +--------------------------+
             |                                  |
             |                                  |
             v                v
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
|  4. Combine into a Dictionary Observation                   |
|  (e.g., {"obs": obs_data, "action_mask": mask_data})        |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
                             |
                             v
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
|  5. `MaskablePPO` Agent receives the dictionary. It         |
|     applies the mask to its neural network output.          |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
                             |
                             v
+----------------------------------------------------------------+
|  6. Agent samples a new action that is guaranteed to be valid. |
+----------------------------------------------------------------+
```

This architecture dramatically prunes the agent's search space, which is an essential step for making a complex, decomposed action space tractable for learning.

#### **Implementation Plan**

*   [x] **Step 1:** Install `sb3-contrib` (`pip install sb3-contrib`).
*   [x] **Step 2:** Modify `train.py` to import and use `MaskablePPO`.
*   [x] **Step 3:** Modify `DRL_RM_Env` to use a `gym.spaces.Dict` observation space.
*   [x] **Step 4:** Implement the mask generation logic inside the `DRL_RM_Bot`'s `on_step` method.

The next section will provide the full code for these changes.
