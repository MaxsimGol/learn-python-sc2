Training a reinforcement learning agent is an empirical process. To understand if the agent is learning, improving, or stagnating, you must visualize its performance metrics over time. **TensorBoard** is the industry-standard tool for this purpose.

This section provides the standard operating procedure for instrumenting your `stable-baselines3` training runs to generate and view TensorBoard logs.

#### **The Role of TensorBoard**

TensorBoard runs as a local web server that parses log files generated during training and displays them as interactive graphs in your web browser. This allows you to monitor key metrics in real-time and analyze the agent's learning trajectory.

#### **Instrumentation and Visualization Workflow**

The process involves two parallel tasks: running the training script to generate logs and running the TensorBoard server to consume them.

#### **Setup and Execution**

*   **Step 1: Instrument the Training Script**
    This step is already complete in our `train.py` script. The `tensorboard_log` parameter directs `stable-baselines3` to write logs to the specified directory.

    *In `train.py`:*
    ```python
    model = PPO(
        # ... other params
        tensorboard_log="./sc2_rl_tensorboard/"
    )
    ```

*   **Step 2: Run the Training Process**
    In your first terminal, with your virtual environment active, start the training as usual.
    ```sh
    python train.py
    ```
    This will create a `sc2_rl_tensorboard/` directory in your project folder and begin populating it with log files.

*   **Step 3: Launch the TensorBoard Server**
    1.  **Open a second, separate terminal window.**
    2.  **Navigate to the same project directory.**
    3.  **Activate the same virtual environment.** This is a critical step, as it ensures the `tensorboard` command is available.
        ```sh
        # Windows
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        # macOS / Linux
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    4.  **Launch the server,** pointing it at the log directory.
        ```sh
        tensorboard --logdir ./sc2_rl_tensorboard/
        ```

---

#### **Expected Outcome**

After running the launch command, your second terminal will display a message similar to this:

`TensorBoard 2.15.2 at http://localhost:6006/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)`

Navigating to **`http://localhost:6006/`** in your web browser will open the TensorBoard dashboard. As your agent trains in the first terminal, you can refresh this dashboard to see the graphs update with new data, providing a live view of the learning process. In the next section, we will cover which of these graphs are most important to watch.
