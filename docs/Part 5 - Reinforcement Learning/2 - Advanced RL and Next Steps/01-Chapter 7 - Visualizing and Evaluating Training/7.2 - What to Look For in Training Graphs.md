TensorBoard provides a rich suite of metrics, but effective diagnostics requires focusing on a few key indicators. These graphs tell a story about the health and progress of your agent's learning process. By learning to interpret their patterns, you can quickly diagnose issues with your environment design or hyperparameter tuning.

All the following metrics are found in the **SCALARS** tab of the TensorBoard dashboard.

#### **Primary Diagnostic Metrics**

This table outlines the four most critical metrics for assessing a training run.

| Metric (TensorBoard Tag) | Primary Question Answered | Healthy Pattern (Desired Trend) | Problem Pattern (Indicates an Issue) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`rollout/ep_rew_mean`**| **"Is the agent learning?"** | **Steadily increasing.**<br />`  ^`<br />`  |     .·´`<br />`  |   .·´`<br />`  | .·´`<br />`--+------> time`<br />This is the definitive indicator of successful learning. The agent is getting better at maximizing its cumulative reward. | **Flat, erratic, or decreasing.**<br />`  ^`<br />`  | .·--·.`<br />`  |/      ·`<br />`  |       `<br />`--+------> time`<br />The agent is not learning. The reward function is likely flawed or the learning rate is too low. |
| **`train/loss`** | **"Is the training process stable?"** | **Steadily decreasing.**<br />`  ^`<br />`  |·`<br />`  | ·.`<br />`  |   `·..`<br />`--+------> time`<br />The model's predictions are becoming more accurate and confident over time. | **Flat, increasing, or very noisy.**<br />`  ^`<br />`  |   ·-·`<br />`  | ·´`<br />`  |·`<br />`--+------> time`<br />The training is unstable. The learning rate is likely too high, or the observation space is poorly designed. |
| **`train/entropy_loss`** | **"Is the agent exploring enough?"** | **Gradually decreasing.**<br />`  ^`<br />`  |·`<br />`  | `·.`<br />`  |   `·..`<br />`--+------> time`<br />The agent begins by exploring randomly (high entropy) and becomes more decisive as it learns a good policy (low entropy). | **Collapses to zero too quickly.**<br />`  ^`<br />`  |·`<br />`  | `·..___`<br />`  |`<br />`--+------> time`<br />Premature convergence. The agent stopped exploring and is likely stuck in a suboptimal policy. Consider increasing the `ent_coef` hyperparameter. |
| **`rollout/ep_len_mean`**| **"Is the agent achieving its goal efficiently?"** | **Depends on the task goal.**<br />For **"reach a goal"** tasks (Worker/Macro bots), a **decreasing** length is good (it's getting faster).<br />For **"survival"** tasks (Micro bot), an **increasing** length is good. | **The trend opposes the task goal.**<br />If the Micro bot's episode length is decreasing, it's learning to die faster. This is a classic sign that the reward function is inadvertently incentivizing the wrong outcome. |
