The `python-sc2` library is an abstraction layer. It acts as a sophisticated translator, converting the complex, raw data stream from the StarCraft II engine into clean, easy-to-use Python objects like `Unit` and `Units`. For 99% of developers, this high-level interface is the best and most productive way to build a bot.

However, for advanced users who require absolute control or need to access data not exposed by the high-level helpers, the library provides a direct "escape hatch" to the raw API data.

**Warning:** This is an advanced topic. Using the raw API requires a deep understanding of the underlying game protocol and significantly increases code complexity.

#### **The Data Flow: High-Level vs. Raw**

This diagram illustrates the two paths data can take to your bot's logic.

```
+--------------------+

          |
          | (Provides a direct passthrough)
          v

#### **Why and When to Use the Raw API**

| Scenario | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **1. Accessing Unexposed Data** | The most legitimate reason. There may be rare or newly added data fields in the game's protocol that `python-sc2` does not yet parse into a high-level helper. The raw API is your only way to access these. |
| **2. Extreme Performance Optimization** | For top-tier competitive bots, the process of creating Python `Unit` objects on every step can introduce a tiny amount of overhead. An expert might bypass this by creating their own, more efficient data structures directly from the raw data. This is a significant undertaking. |
| **3. Library Debugging** | If you suspect a bug in how `python-sc2` is interpreting the game state, you can compare the data from the high-level helpers against the "ground truth" provided by the raw API to diagnose the issue. |

#### **The Trade-Offs: What You Gain and What You Lose**

| Aspect | High-Level API (`self.units`) | Raw API (`self.observation_raw.raw_data.units`) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ease of Use** | **Very High.** Clean objects, intuitive property names. | **Very Low.** Deeply nested, verbose Protobuf objects. |
| **Readability** | `if marine.is_idle:` | `if not raw_marine.orders:` |
| **Helper Methods**| **Abundant.** `.distance_to`, `.target_in_range`, etc. | **None.** You must implement all calculations yourself. |
| **Performance** | Excellent for almost all use cases. | Potentially faster, but only if you build a highly optimized custom data layer to replace the library's. |
| **Control** | High. | **Absolute.** Direct access to every field the API provides. |

#### **Code Example: A Raw Data Inspector**

This example demonstrates how to access the raw Protobuf objects and contrasts them with their high-level equivalents. Note the verbosity and the different property names.

```python
# raw_api_inspector.py

from sc2 import maps
from sc2.bot_ai import BotAI
from sc2.data import Difficulty, Race
from sc2.main import run_game
from sc2.player import Bot, Computer
# Import the raw protocol buffer definitions.
from s2clientprotocol import sc2api_pb2 as sc_pb

class RawAPIInspectorBot(BotAI):
    """A bot that inspects and compares raw vs. high-level API data."""

    async def on_step(self, iteration: int):
        # We only want to run this once to avoid spamming the console.
        if iteration == 5:
            marine = None
            print("--- High-Level API (Recommended) ---")
            # Get the first unit using the clean, high-level interface.
            # Safely get the first unit, if one exists.
            if self.units:
                marine = self.units.first
                print(f"Unit: {marine.name}")
                print(f"Health: {marine.health}/{marine.health_max}")
                print(f"Position: {marine.position.rounded}")
            else:
                print("No units found with the high-level API.")


            print("\n--- Raw API (Advanced) ---")
            # Get the raw observation object for the current step.
            observation: sc_pb.Observation = self.observation_raw
            # Access the list of raw unit Protobufs.
            raw_units = observation.raw_data.units

            # Find the raw unit with the same tag as our high-level marine.
            # This check will only succeed if a unit was found above.
            if marine:
                raw_marine_proto = next((u for u in raw_units if u.tag == marine.tag), None)
                if raw_marine_proto:
                    # Note the different property names and data types.
                    print(f"Unit Tag: {raw_marine_proto.tag}")
                    print(f"Unit Type ID: {raw_marine_proto.unit_type}")
                    print(f"Health: {raw_marine_proto.health}/{raw_marine_proto.health_max}")
                    # Position is a nested object.
                    print(f"Position: (x={raw_marine_proto.pos.x:.2f}, y={raw_marine_proto.pos.y:.2f})")
                else:
                    print(f"Could not find raw unit with tag {marine.tag}")
            elif raw_units:
                print(f"Total raw units found: {len(raw_units)}")
            else:
                print("No units found with the raw API.")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_game(
        maps.get("AcropolisLE"),
        [
            Bot(Race.Terran, RawAPIInspectorBot()),
            Computer(Race.Zerg, Difficulty.Easy)
        ],
        realtime=True,
    )
```
**Conclusion:** The raw API is a powerful tool for experts with specific, demanding requirements. For all other developers, the standard high-level interface provides the ideal balance of power, performance, and readability.
