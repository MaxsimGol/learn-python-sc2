No developer works in a vacuum. Bot development is a challenging field, and leveraging the collective knowledge of the community is essential for success. The two pillars of the `python-sc2` community are the **Discord server** for real-time discussion and the **GitHub repository** for technical issues and source code.

#### **The Community Hubs: A Comparison**

| Platform | **Discord Server** | **GitHub Repository** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Purpose** | **Real-time help, discussion, and community.** | **Source code, bug reports, and feature requests.** |
| **Best For...** | - Asking "How do I...?" questions.<br />- Getting strategic advice.<br />- Sharing your bot and replays.<br />- Quick, informal feedback. | - Reporting bugs in the library.<br />- Suggesting new features.<br />- Browsing the source code.<br />- Formal, technical issues. |
| **Key Location** | **`#python` channel** | **`Issues` tab** |

#### **The SC2 AI Arena Discord: Your First Stop for Help**

The Discord server is the living, breathing heart of the StarCraft II AI community. It is the most effective place to get help with your bot. Join the server here: [https://discord.gg/Emm5Ztz](https://discord.gg/Emm5Ztz)

**Checklist for Asking a Good Question:**
-   [ ] **1. Choose the Right Channel:** Use the **`#python`** channel for `python-sc2` library questions.
-   [ ] **2. Be Specific:** Instead of "My bot doesn't work," describe the exact problem: "My Marines won't attack the enemy, even when they are idle. Here is my code."
-   [ ] **3. Provide Context:**
    -   [ ] **Post Your Code:** Use Discord's code blocks (```python ... ```) for small snippets, or a link to your GitHub repository for larger projects.
    -   [ ] **Include the Error:** Copy and paste the full error message and traceback.
    -   [ ] **State Your Goal:** Explain what you are *trying* to achieve.

#### **The `BurnySc2/python-sc2` GitHub: The Technical Foundation**

The GitHub repository is the official home of the library. It is your primary resource for understanding the code itself and for contributing to its development.

*   **Link:** [https://github.com/BurnySc2/python-sc2](https://github.com/BurnySc2/python-sc2)

**Checklist for Using GitHub Effectively:**
-   [ ] **1. Before Reporting a Bug:**
    -   [ ] Search the existing "Issues" to see if someone has already reported the same problem.
    -   [ ] Make sure the problem is with the **library**, not your own bot's logic. (When in doubt, ask on Discord first!)
-   [ ] **2. When Reporting a Bug:**
    -   [ ] Provide a **Minimal, Reproducible Example:** A small, self-contained piece of code that demonstrates the bug.
    -   [ ] Specify your `python-sc2` version, Python version, and operating system.
    -   [ ] Clearly describe the expected behavior vs. the actual behavior.
-   [ ] **3. To Stay Updated:**
    -   [ ] "Watch" the repository to receive notifications about new releases and major changes.


**In summary:**
-   **Questions and Discussion -> Discord**
-   **Library Bugs and Source Code -> GitHub**

By engaging with these resources, you are not just getting help; you are becoming part of a community that works together to build smarter, more interesting, and more powerful StarCraft II bots.
