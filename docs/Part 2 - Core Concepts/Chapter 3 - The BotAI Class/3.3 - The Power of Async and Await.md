The `async` and `await` keywords are the engine of `python-sc2`. They are not optional features; they are the fundamental mechanism that allows your bot to remain responsive and intelligent. Understanding their purpose is non-negotiable for writing a functional bot.

#### **The Core Problem: Your Bot is a Network Client**

Every action your bot takes—building a unit, moving a Marine, querying for resources—is not an instant, local function call. It is a network request sent to the StarCraft II game engine, which then processes it and sends a response.

```
+------------------+         (Commands & Queries)         +---------------+
|                  | <----------------------------------> |               |
|  Your Python Bot |                                      |  SC2 Game     |
|                  | <----------------------------------> |   Engine      |
+------------------+          (Game State & Acks)         +---------------+
                      <- This round trip takes time ->
```

In a traditional, synchronous program, your code would **freeze** and wait for the game engine's response after every single command. For an RTS bot that needs to make hundreds of decisions per second, this is fatal.

#### **The Solution: The Non-Blocking `asyncio` Model**

`asyncio` allows your bot to be a "non-blocking" client. It can send a command and, instead of freezing, immediately yield control to work on other tasks. It's the difference between a worker who stops everything to watch a pot boil and one who starts the boil, then goes to chop vegetables, checking back periodically.

| Synchronous (Blocking) Bot | Asynchronous (Non-Blocking) Bot |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1. Issues "build" command. | 1. Issues "build" command. |
| 2. **FREEZES**. Waits for SC2 to confirm. | 2. **YIELDS**. Immediately moves on. |
| 3. (Waits...) | 3. Issues "attack" command. |
| 4. (Waits...) | 4. **YIELDS**. Immediately moves on. |
| 5. Receives "build" confirmation. | 5. Checks if it can afford an upgrade. |
| 6. Finally issues "attack" command. | 6. (Receives confirmations in the background). |

The asynchronous bot accomplishes far more in the same amount of time, making it an effective RTS player.

#### **The Rules of Implementation: The `async`/`await` Contract**

To use this model, you must adhere to a simple two-part contract.

```
.------------------------------------------.
| async def my_method(self):               |  <-- Marks a function as a "coroutine"
|                                          |      that can be paused.
|     # Do some logic...                   |
|                                          |
|     await some_game_action()             |  <-- Pauses the coroutine here until the
|                                          |      action is acknowledged by the game.
|     # Continue logic after ack...        |
`------------------------------------------`
```

**Implementation Checklist:**
-   [ ] **Rule 1: Define with `async def`.** Any method that contains a game action or query (`on_step`, `on_start`, your own helper functions) **must** be defined with `async def`.
-   [ ] **Rule 2: Call with `await`.** Any function call that communicates with the game (e.g., `self.build`, `unit.attack`, `self.expand_now`) **must** be preceded by the `await` keyword.

#### **The Most Common Mistake: The Forgotten `await`**

Forgetting `await` is the #1 error for new `python-sc2` developers.
If you call an `async` function without `await`, **the action will simply not happen.**

**Your Clue:** The program will not crash. Instead, you will see a warning in your console that looks like this:
```
RuntimeWarning: coroutine 'Unit.attack' was never awaited
```
If you see this, you have found the bug. Go to that line of code and add `await`.

#### **Code Example: A Tale of Two Pylons**

This bot tries to build two Pylons. One command is issued correctly, the other is not. Observe the difference in both the game and your console output.

```python
from sc2 import main
from sc2.bot_ai import BotAI
from sc2.ids.unit_typeid import UnitTypeId
from sc2.player import Bot
from sc2.race import Race

class AwaitBot(BotAI):
    """A bot to demonstrate the critical importance of 'await'."""

    async def on_step(self, iteration: int):
        # We want this logic to run only once, as soon as we can afford the Pylons.
        # This checks if we have no Pylons and none are pending construction.
        if self.structures(UnitTypeId.PYLON).amount + self.already_pending(UnitTypeId.PYLON) == 0:
            # We wait until we can afford two Pylons for the demonstration.
            if self.minerals >= 200:
                await self._build_pylons_correctly()
                await self._build_pylons_incorrectly()

    async def _build_pylons_correctly(self):
        """This function correctly awaits the build command."""
        print("ACTION: Issuing CORRECT build command for Pylon 1...")
        if self.workers.exists:
            # CORRECT: The 'await' keyword ensures the command is sent and processed.
            await self.build(UnitTypeId.PYLON, near=self.workers.first)

    async def _build_pylons_incorrectly(self):
        """
        This function is correctly defined with 'async def' but forgets
        to await the build command internally.
        """
        print("ACTION: Issuing INCORRECT build command for Pylon 2...")
        if self.workers.exists:
            # INCORRECT: This creates a coroutine object but never runs it.
            # It does nothing in-game and will raise a RuntimeWarning.
            self.build(UnitTypeId.PYLON, near=self.start_location.towards(self.game_info.map_center, 8))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main.run_game(
        main.maps.get("AcropolisLE"),
        [Bot(Race.Protoss, AwaitBot())],
        realtime=True,
    )
```
When you run this, you will see one Pylon get built and a `RuntimeWarning` in your console. This is the `await` contract in action.
