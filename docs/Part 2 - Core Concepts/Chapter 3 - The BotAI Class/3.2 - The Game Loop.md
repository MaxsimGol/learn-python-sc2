Your bot's code does not run all at once. It's an event-driven program that reacts to the game's state. The `BotAI` class provides a "three-act structure" for your bot's life within a match, giving you specific entry points to insert your logic. Understanding this flow is essential for building a well-structured AI.

#### **The Execution Flow**

This diagram illustrates the guaranteed order of execution for the primary lifecycle methods.

```
(Game Client Loads)
         |
         v
.--- on_start() --.
| (Runs ONCE)     |
`-----------------`
         |
         v
.--- on_step() ---.
| (Loops)         | <------.
| - Perceive      |        |
| - Decide        |        | (Runs ~22 times/sec)
| - Act           |        |
`-----------------`--------`
         |
         | (Game Ends)
         v
.--- on_end() ----.
| (Runs ONCE)     |
`-----------------`
         |
         v
(Program Exits)

#### **The Lifecycle Methods: A Comparison**

| Method | `async def on_start(self)` | `async def on_step(self, iteration: int)` | `async def on_end(self, game_result: Result)` |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **When It Runs** | **Once**, at the very beginning of the match. | **Repeatedly**, on every game tick (~22.4 times/sec). | **Once**, after the match has concluded. |
| **Core Purpose** | **Initialization.** Set up state and perform one-time calculations. | **Execution.** The main loop for all real-time decision-making. | **Analysis & Cleanup.** Save data and log the final outcome. |
| **Key Parameters**| `self` | `iteration`: The game frame counter. | `game_result`: The final outcome (Victory, Defeat). |
| **Common Uses** | - Print bot strategy<br />- Analyze map layout<br />- Set initial state (`self.is_attacking = False`) | - Manage economy<br />- Control the army<br />- Scout the enemy<br />- Execute build orders | - Log win/loss rates<br />- Save learned data to a file<br />- Analyze replay data |

#### **A Quick Primer on `async` and `await`**

You'll notice all these methods are defined with `async def`. This is because `python-sc2` is an **asynchronous** library.

*   **What it means:** Your bot communicates with the StarCraft II game over a network connection. Actions like sending a command or requesting data take time. An asynchronous design prevents your entire bot from freezing while it waits for the game to respond.
*   **How it works:**
    *   `async def` marks a function as a "coroutine"—a special function that can be paused and resumed.
    *   `await` is the keyword you use to "pause" the function and wait for a time-consuming operation (like issuing a command) to complete before moving to the next line.

**Rule of Thumb:** If you are calling a function that performs an action in the game (e.g., attacking, building, moving), you **must** use `await` before it.

#### **Code Example: A Lifecycle in Action**

This bot demonstrates the full lifecycle, logs its state at each phase, and uses a time-based trigger to end the game.

**Checklist for This Bot:**
- [ ] Use `on_start` to set up an initial state.
- [ ] Use `on_step` with a time-based condition to perform a primary action.
- [ ] Use `await` to call an asynchronous game action (`self.client.leave()`).
- [ ] Use `on_end` to analyze and report the final result.
