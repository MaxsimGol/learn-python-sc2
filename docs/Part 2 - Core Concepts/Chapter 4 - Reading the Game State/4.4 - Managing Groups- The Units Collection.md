A single `Unit` is an atom, but StarCraft II is a game of armies. To manage groups of units—your entire worker line, your main army, or an enemy attack wave—you need a more powerful tool. The `Units` object is that tool.

It is a specialized collection of `Unit` objects, supercharged with methods designed specifically for the logic of an RTS. Mastering the `Units` collection is the key to writing clean, efficient, and readable code for managing groups.

#### **The Power of a Fluent API: Chaining Queries**

The `Units` object uses a **fluent API**, which means that most of its filtering methods return a *new* `Units` object. This allows you to chain methods together, building a highly specific query from left to right. It is a far more powerful and readable alternative to nested loops and `if` statements.

```
[ self.units ] -> A huge collection of all your units.
     |
     v
[ .of_type(MARINE) ] -> Only Marines.
     |
     v
[ .idle ] -> Only idle Marines.
     |
     v
[ .sorted(key) ] -> Only idle Marines, sorted by distance.
     |
     v
[ .first ] -> The single, closest, idle Marine.
```
This elegant, single line of code replaces what would otherwise be a complex and error-prone block of loops.

#### **Key `Units` Methods: A Developer's Toolkit**

These methods can be grouped by their function.

| Category | Method | What It Returns | Primary Use Case in a Project |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Checking** | `.exists` <br /> `.amount` | `bool` <br /> `int` | The most common checks: "Do I have any marines?" (`if marines.exists:`). |
| **Selecting** | `.first` <br /> `.random` <br /> `.random_or(None)` | `Unit` <br /> `Unit` <br /> `Unit` or `None` | Grabbing a single unit from a collection. `.random_or(None)` is the safest option. |
| **Filtering** | `.of_type(type_id)` <br /> `.idle` <br /> `.ready` <br /> `.closer_than(dist, pos)` <br /> `.further_than(dist, pos)` | `Units` | These are the core of the fluent API. They narrow down your collection to only the units that match a specific criteria. |
| **Ordering & Finding** | `.sorted(key)` <br /> `.closest_to(pos)` <br /> `.furthest_to(pos)` <br /> `.center` | `Units` <br /> `Unit` <br /> `Unit` <br /> `Point2` | Used after filtering to find the best candidate from a group, or to find the group's center of mass. |

#### **A Developer's Checklist for Managing a Group**

When you need to command a group of units, follow this process:

-   [ ] **1. Start Broad:** Get the initial collection (e.g., `self.units`).
-   [ ] **2. Filter by Type:** Narrow it down to the units you care about (e.g., `self.units(UnitTypeId.MARINE)`).
-   [ ] **3. Filter by State:** Apply state-based filters (e.g., `.idle`, `.ready`).
-   [ ] **4. Check for Existence:** Always check `.exists` before trying to access a unit from the collection.
-   [ ] **5. Select or Iterate:** Grab a single unit (`.closest_to()`) or loop through the entire filtered collection to issue commands.

#### **Code Example: The Army Commander Bot**

This bot demonstrates advanced use of `Units` collections to manage an army. It will group idle units into a control group and send them to attack, while also pulling back damaged units from the front line.

```python
# army_commander_bot.py

from sc2.ids.unit_typeid import UnitTypeId

            attack_target = self.enemy_structures.random.position

        # 1. Manage the main army.
        await self.manage_army(attack_target)

        # 2. Keep building units to reinforce the army.
        await self.train_reinforcements()


    async def manage_army(self, attack_target):

        marines: Units = self.units(UnitTypeId.MARINE)

        # Use chained queries to form two distinct groups.
        # Group 1: Healthy marines that are idle and ready to attack.
        idle_and_healthy_marines: Units = marines.idle.filter(lambda m: m.health_percentage > 0.8)

        # Group 2: Any marine that is damaged, regardless of what it's doing.
        damaged_marines: Units = marines.filter(lambda m: m.health_percentage <= 0.8)

        # Command the idle and healthy group to attack the target.
        if idle_and_healthy_marines.exists:
            # We can issue a command to the entire Units collection at once.
            self.do(idle_and_healthy_marines.attack(attack_target))

        # Command the damaged group to retreat to a safe rally point.
        if damaged_marines.exists:
            safe_rally_point = self.start_location.towards(self.game_info.map_center, 15)
            self.do(damaged_marines.move(safe_rally_point))

        if self.can_afford(UnitTypeId.MARINE) and idle_barracks.exists:
            # Train a marine from a random idle barracks.
            idle_barracks.random.train(UnitTypeId.MARINE)

        # Build prerequisite structures if they don't exist.
        elif not self.structures(UnitTypeId.BARRACKS).exists and self.can_afford(UnitTypeId.BARRACKS):
             await self.build(UnitTypeId.BARRACKS, near=self.start_location.towards(self.game_info.map_center, 8))
