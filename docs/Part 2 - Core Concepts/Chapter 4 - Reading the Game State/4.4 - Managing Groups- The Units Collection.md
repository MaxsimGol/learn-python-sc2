A single `Unit` is an atom, but StarCraft II is a game of armies. To manage groups of units—your entire worker line, your main army, or an enemy attack wave—you need a more powerful tool. The `Units` object is that tool.

It is a specialized collection of `Unit` objects, supercharged with methods designed specifically for the logic of an RTS. Mastering the `Units` collection is the key to writing clean, efficient, and readable code for managing groups.

#### **The Power of a Fluent API: Chaining Queries**

The `Units` object uses a **fluent API**, which means that most of its filtering methods return a *new* `Units` object. This allows you to chain methods together, building a highly specific query from left to right. It is a far more powerful and readable alternative to nested loops and `if` statements.

```
[ self.units ] -> A huge collection of all your units.
     |
     v
[ .of_type(MARINE) ] -> Only Marines.
     |
     v
[ .idle ] -> Only idle Marines.
     |
     v
[ .sorted(key) ] -> Only idle Marines, sorted by distance.
     |
     v
[ .first ] -> The single, closest, idle Marine.
```
This elegant, single line of code replaces what would otherwise be a complex and error-prone block of loops.

#### **Key `Units` Methods: A Developer's Toolkit**

These methods can be grouped by their function.

| Category | Method | What It Returns | Primary Use Case in a Project |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Checking** | `.exists` <br /> `.amount` | `bool` <br /> `int` | The most common checks: "Do I have any marines?" (`if marines.exists:`). |
| **Selecting** | `.first` <br /> `.random` <br /> `.random_or(None)` | `Unit` <br /> `Unit` <br /> `Unit` or `None` | Grabbing a single unit from a collection. `.random_or(None)` is the safest option. |
| **Filtering** | `.of_type(type_id)` <br /> `.idle` <br /> `.ready` <br /> `.closer_than(dist, pos)` <br /> `.further_than(dist, pos)` | `Units` | These are the core of the fluent API. They narrow down your collection to only the units that match a specific criteria. |
| **Ordering & Finding** | `.sorted(key)` <br /> `.closest_to(pos)` <br /> `.furthest_to(pos)` <br /> `.center` | `Units` <br /> `Unit` <br /> `Unit` <br /> `Point2` | Used after filtering to find the best candidate from a group, or to find the group's center of mass. |

#### **A Developer's Checklist for Managing a Group**

When you need to command a group of units, follow this process:

-   [ ] **1. Start Broad:** Get the initial collection (e.g., `self.units`).
-   [ ] **2. Filter by Type:** Narrow it down to the units you care about (e.g., `self.units(UnitTypeId.MARINE)`).
-   [ ] **3. Filter by State:** Apply state-based filters (e.g., `.idle`, `.ready`).
-   [ ] **4. Check for Existence:** Always check `.exists` before trying to access a unit from the collection.
-   [ ] **5. Select or Iterate:** Grab a single unit (`.closest_to()`) or loop through the entire filtered collection to issue commands.

#### **Code Example: The Army Commander Bot**

This bot demonstrates advanced use of `Units` collections to manage an army. It will group idle units into a control group and send them to attack, while also pulling back damaged units from the front line.
