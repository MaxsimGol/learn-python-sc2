If `self.game_info` is the unchanging blueprint of the battlefield, then the data available through `self.state` and its convenience properties represents your bot's real-time **senses**. This is the dynamic information—minerals, supply, unit positions, time—that changes on every single frame of the game.

Mastering your bot's senses is the key to reactive, intelligent behavior. This data is the input for every decision your bot will ever make.

#### **The Core AI Loop: Sense, Think, Act**

Your `on_step` method should be structured around this fundamental AI control loop.

```
.-------------------- SENSE ------------------------.
|   - What are my resources? (self.minerals)        |
|   - How much supply do I have? (self.supply_left) |
|   - Where are my units? (self.units)              |
|   - Where are the enemy units? (self.enemy_units) |
`---------------------------------------------------`
                      |
                      v
.-------------------- THINK --------------------.
|   if self.minerals > 100:                     |
|   if self.supply_left < 5:                    |
|   if self.enemy_units.in_attack_range_of(x):  |
`---------------------------------------------`
                      |
                      v
.--------------------- ACT ---------------------.
|   await self.build(UnitTypeId.BARRACKS, ...)  |
|   barracks.train(UnitTypeId.MARINE)           |
`---------------------------------------------`
```
Your bot continuously cycles through this loop within `on_step`, sensing the world, applying its strategic logic, and issuing commands.

#### **Key Dynamic Properties (Your Bot's Senses)**

While the raw data lives in `self.state`, the `BotAI` class provides easy-to-use convenience properties. **You should always prefer these helpers.**

| Category | Property | Data Type | Practical Use in a Project |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Resources** | `self.minerals`<br />`self.vespene` | `int` | The primary input for `self.can_afford()` checks. The foundation of your economy. |
| **Supply** | `self.supply_used`<br />`self.supply_cap`<br />`self.supply_left` | `int` | Triggers the construction of new Supply Depots, Pylons, or Overlords to avoid being supply-blocked. |
| **Time** | `self.time`<br />`self.time_formatted` | `float`<br />`str` | Used for timing build orders, scouting schedules, and logging events. `self.time` is more reliable than `iteration`.|
| **Your Units** | `self.units`<br />`self.structures`<br />`self.workers`<br />`self.townhalls` | `Units` | The main tools for managing your forces. Used to find idle units, issue commands, and check army composition. |
| **Enemy Units**| `self.enemy_units`<br />`self.enemy_structures` | `Units` | The primary input for all combat and reactive logic. Used to check for threats and identify targets. |
| **Production**| `self.already_pending(unit_id)`| `int` or `float` | Crucial for preventing redundant actions, like building two Supply Depots when you only need one. |
| **For RL Devs**| All of the above | N/A | These properties form the core of a structured observation space for a Reinforcement Learning agent. Normalizing these values (e.g., supply used / 200) is a common and effective practice. |

#### **A Developer's Decision-Making Checklist**

When writing your `on_step` logic, follow this thought process:

-   [ ] **1. Am I alive?** Check if you have townhalls. If not, you've likely lost.
-   [ ] **2. Can I spend my money?** Check `self.minerals` and `self.vespene`. Idle resources are wasted resources.
-   [ ] **3. Am I supply-blocked?** Check `self.supply_left`. If it's too low, building supply should be your #1 priority.
-   [ ] **4. Are my production buildings busy?** Find idle townhalls, barracks, etc., and queue a unit.
-   [ ] **5. Am I under attack?** Check if `self.enemy_units` are near your key structures.

#### **Code Example: The Starter Macro Bot**

This bot demonstrates a robust, basic macroeconomic cycle. It constantly builds workers and ensures it never gets supply-blocked—the two most important skills for any new bot.
