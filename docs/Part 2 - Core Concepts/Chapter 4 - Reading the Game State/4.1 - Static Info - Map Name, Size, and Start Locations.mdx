Before a single unit moves, your bot needs a complete understanding of the environment. The `self.game_info` object is your access to this **static blueprint**. Think of it as the unchangeable physical game board: the map's size, terrain, and starting positions are all fixed at the beginning of the match and will not change.

This information is your foundation for all high-level strategy. It's available from `on_start()` onwards and is essential for planning expansions, identifying chokepoints, and, most importantly, finding your enemy.

#### **The Most Important Data: Start Locations**

Locating the enemy is your first priority. The library provides several properties to help, and it's critical to understand the difference.

```
      THE MAP (e.g., Acropolis LE)
+------------------------------------+
| P1 o                               |  P1: Your bot's actual start
|(self.start_location)               |
|                                    |
|                                    |  
|                                    |
|                                    |
|                               o P3 |  2: The enemy's actual start
|     (self.enemy_start_locations[0])|
+------------------------------------+
```

| Property                 | What It Is                                                           | Common Use                                                                             |
| :----------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `self.start_location`    | Your *exact* starting `Point2`.                                      | Finding the center of your own base.                                                   |
| `self.enemy_start_locations` | A `list` of your opponents' *exact* starting locations.              | **The primary way you find the enemy in a 1v1.**                                       |

#### **The `self.game_info` Attribute Table**

This table details the core components of the battlefield blueprint and their strategic value.

| Attribute | Data Type | Description & Practical Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`map_name`** | `str` | The name of the map file (e.g., "AbyssalReefLE").<br />**Use:** Log which maps your bot wins or loses on. |
| **`map_size`** | `Size` | Dimensions (`.width`, `.height`) of the map.<br />**Use:** Judge travel times and estimate the size of your army. |
| **`playable_area`** | `Rect` | A rectangle defining the map's playable boundaries.<br />**Use:** Keep your units from getting stuck on unplayable edges. |
| **`pathing_grid`** | `PixelMap` | A 2D array showing walkable terrain for ground units.<br />**Use (Advanced):** Find chokepoints or wall-off locations by analyzing pathable tiles. |
| **`placement_grid`**| `PixelMap` | A 2D array showing where buildings can be constructed.<br />**Use (Advanced):** Find optimal, non-blocking spots for buildings. |
| **For RL Developers** | N/A | This static data is perfect for an RL agent's observation space, as it only needs to be processed once, reducing the complexity of per-frame observations. |

#### **Practical Application Checklist**

Here is how you should think about using `self.game_info` in your own projects:

-   [ ] **1. Find the Enemy:** Immediately grab `self.enemy_start_locations[0]` to get your primary target.
-   [ ] **2. Plan Expansions:** Find the closest base location in `self.expansion_locations_list` (a helper property) to your `self.start_location` or use `self.get_next_expansion()` that finds the closest, unoccupied expansion location to your existing bases.
-   [ ] **3. Determine Build Patterns:** Use your start location to decide on safe places to build, like placing a Supply Depot behind your mineral line.
-   [ ] **4. Set Rally Points:** Calculate a safe rally point between your base and the enemy's for newly trained units.

#### **Code Example: The Strategist Bot**

This bot uses `self.game_info` in `on_start` to make several strategic decisions at the very beginning of the game.

```python
# strategist_bot.py

from sc2.main import run_game
from sc2 import maps
from sc2.bot_ai import BotAI
from sc2.ids.unit_typeid import UnitTypeId
from sc2.player import Bot, Computer
from sc2.data import Difficulty, Race


class StrategistBot(BotAI):
    """A bot that uses static info to make initial strategic decisions."""

    async def on_start(self):
        """Analyze the blueprint and set up a basic plan."""
        print("--- Battlefield Blueprint Analysis ---")

        # 1. Find the enemy's main base. This is our primary target.
        self.enemy_main_base = self.enemy_start_locations[0]
        print(f"Enemy main located at: {self.enemy_main_base.rounded}")

        # 2. Find a safe position behind our mineral line to build depots.
        # This uses vector math to move from our townhall away from the main ramp.
        self.safe_build_position = self.start_location.towards(
            self.main_base_ramp.top_center, -8
        )
        print(f"Designated safe building position: {self.safe_build_position.rounded}")

        # 3. Designate a scout. We'll tag one worker for this role.
        # Note: We store the tag, not the unit object, as the object can become stale.
        self.scout_tag = self.workers.random.tag
        print(f"Worker {self.scout_tag} has been assigned scouting duty.")
        print("--- Analysis Complete ---")

    async def on_step(self, iteration: int):
        """Execute the plan set in on_start."""
        # Action 1: Send the designated scout to the enemy base on the first step.
        if iteration == 0:
            scout_unit = self.workers.by_tag(self.scout_tag)
            if scout_unit:
                scout_unit.attack(self.enemy_main_base)
                print(f"ACTION: Scout {self.scout_tag} dispatched to enemy base.")

        # Action 2: Build a Supply Depot when we are close to our supply cap.
        # We also check if we can afford it and are not already building one.
        if (
            self.supply_left < 5
            and self.can_afford(UnitTypeId.SUPPLYDEPOT)
            and self.already_pending(UnitTypeId.SUPPLYDEPOT) == 0
        ):
            # self.build is async, so it must be awaited.
            await self.build(UnitTypeId.SUPPLYDEPOT, near=self.safe_build_position)
            print(
                f"ACTION: Building Supply Depot at safe location {self.safe_build_position.rounded}."
            )


if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_game(
        maps.get("AbyssalReefLE"),
        [Bot(Race.Terran, StrategistBot()), Computer(Race.Zerg, Difficulty.Easy)],
        realtime=True,
    )
