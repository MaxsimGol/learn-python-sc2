Once your base includes production structures, your bot's focus shifts to converting resources into military power. The commands for training units (`.train()`) and researching upgrades (`.research()`) are simple **Commands**, not **Queries**. They are non-blocking and should be called directly without `await`.

However, to use them effectively, your bot must follow a complete, five-step validation lifecycle to ensure every production request is possible, non-redundant, and technologically feasible.

#### **The Complete Production Lifecycle**

A robust production system must validate a request against all five of these conditions before issuing a command.

```
(You want to produce something...)
           |
           v
.---  1. IS IT POSSIBLE? (Economic Check) ---.
| - self.can_afford()                      |
| - self.supply_left > 0                   | (For units)
`------------------------------------------`
           | (Yes)
           v
.--- 2. IS IT REDUNDANT? (State Check) ---.
| - self.already_pending() == 0          |
| - upgrade not in self.state.upgrades   | (For upgrades)
`--------------------------------------`
           | (No)
           v
.--- 3. DO I HAVE THE TECH? (Requirement Check) ---.
| - self.tech_requirement_progress(ITEM) == 1.0  |
`------------------------------------------------`
           | (Yes)
           v
.--- 4. WHERE CAN I MAKE IT? (Building Check) ---.
| - building = self.structures(TYPE).ready.idle.first |
`-----------------------------------------------`
           | (Building exists)
           v
.---- 5. ISSUE COMMAND ----.
| - building.train(UNIT)  |
| - building.research(UPGRADE) |
`-----------------------`
```

#### **Deep Dive 1- Tracking Completed Upgrades with `self.state.upgrades`**

*   **`self.state.upgrades`**: This is a Python `set` containing the `UpgradeId` of every upgrade your bot has successfully completed.
*   **The Check:** `upgrade_id not in self.state.upgrades` is a highly efficient boolean check that returns `True` if you do not yet have the upgrade.

#### **Deep Dive 2- Verifying Tech with `self.tech_requirement_progress()`**

*   **`self.tech_requirement_progress(item_id)`**: This is a query that asks, "What percentage (from 0.0 to 1.0) of the tech requirements for this unit or upgrade have I met?"
*   **The Check:** You must verify `self.tech_requirement_progress(item_id) == 1.0` before attempting to produce any unit or upgrade that has a dependency (e.g., checking for an Armory before researching Level 2 weapons).

#### **Code Example- The Quartermaster Bot (with Armory)**

This bot demonstrates the complete five-step lifecycle. It builds an Armory and checks for it as a tech requirement before attempting to research Level 2 upgrades.
