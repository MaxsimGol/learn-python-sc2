Once your base is established, your bot's primary goal is to spend its resources effectively by producing units and enhancing them with upgrades. The commands for training and researching are very similar: you select an eligible building and issue a specific production command.

#### **The Production Request Lifecycle**

Both training and researching follow the same logical flow. Before issuing a command, you must verify that the request is valid.

```
(You want to produce something...)
           |
           v
.---  IS IT POSSIBLE? ------.
| - self.can_afford(ITEM_ID)|  <-- Do I have the resources?
| - self.supply_left > 0    |  <-- (For units only) Do I have supply?
`---------------------------`
           | (Yes)
           v
.--- IS IT REDUNDANT? -----------------.
| - self.already_pending(ITEM_ID) == 0 | <-- Am I already making this??|
`--------------------------------------`
           | (No)
           v
.--- WHERE CAN I MAKE IT? ----------------------------.
| - building = self.structures(TYPE).ready.idle.first |
`-----------------------------------------------------`
           | (Building exists)
           v
.---- ISSUE COMMAND -----------.
| - building.train(UNIT)       |
| - building.research(UPGRADE) |
`------------------------------`
```
Adhering to this lifecycle prevents your bot from getting stuck trying to afford something it can't, or wasting time queuing redundant upgrades.

#### **A Comparison of Production Commands**

| Aspect | Training a Unit | Researching an Upgrade |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Command** | `structure.train(unit_id)` | `structure.research(upgrade_id)` |
| **Target Building** | A production structure (Barracks, Gateway). | A tech structure (Forge, Engineering Bay). |
| **ID Type** | `UnitTypeId` | `UpgradeId` |
| **Pre-checks** | `can_afford`, `supply_left` | `can_afford` |
| **Redundancy Check**| `self.already_pending(unit_id)` | `self.already_pending_upgrade(upgrade_id)` |
| **Finding a Building** | `self.structures(BARRACKS).ready.idle` | `self.structures(FORGE).ready.idle` |

#### **A Developer's Checklist for Production**

Before you write any production logic, answer these questions:

-   [ ] **1. What do I want to build?** (e.g., a Marine)
-   [ ] **2. Can I afford it?** (`self.can_afford(UnitTypeId.MARINE)`)
-   [ ] **3. (For units) Do I have the supply?** (`self.supply_left >= 1`)
-   [ ] **4. Am I already making it?** (`self.already_pending(UnitTypeId.MARINE) == 0`)
-   [ ] **5. Do I have a building that can make it, and is it ready and idle?** (`self.structures(UnitTypeId.BARRACKS).ready.idle`)
-   [ ] **6. If all checks pass, issue the command.**

#### **Code Example: The Quartermaster Bot**

This bot acts as a quartermaster, managing both unit production and research requests. It uses clean, separate functions for each task and demonstrates the robust, query-based approach to finding eligible buildings.
