#### **Attack, Move, Stop, Hold Position**
These four commands are the fundamental verbs of unit control in StarCraft II. They are the primary tools you will use to manage your army's positioning and engagements.

#### **Command Execution**

It is critical to remember that these are simple **Commands**, not **Queries** (as defined in section 5.1).

*   **Execution Model:** "Fire-and-forget."
*   **`await` Required?:** **No.** Calling `unit.attack()` adds the command to the internal action buffer. The library sends all buffered commands at the end of the game step.

#### **A Tactical Comparison of Core Commands**

Choosing the right command is a tactical decision based entirely on your goal for the unit.

| Command | `unit.attack(target)` | `unit.move(target)` | `unit.stop()` | `unit.hold_position()` |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tactical Role** | **Offensive.** Engages and pursues targets. | **Repositioning.** Moves from A to B, ignoring combat. | **Full Stop.** Cancels all actions immediately. | **Defensive.** Holds ground and fires on enemies in range. |
| **Engages Enemies?** | **Yes.** Automatically fights any hostiles encountered. | **No.** Will ignore all enemy units. | **No.** Will not auto-acquire targets. | **Yes.** Will fire on enemies in range but will not chase them. |
| **Target Type** | `Unit` or `Point2` | `Point2` only | None | None |
| **Primary Use Case**| **Attack-Moving an army.** This is the standard command for advancing on the enemy. | Retreating damaged units or positioning non-combat units. | Arranging units precisely for an ambush or special ability. | Establishing a defensive line at a chokepoint or ramp. |

#### **Developer's Tactical Checklist**

When controlling a unit, your logic should answer these questions:

*   [ ] **What is the unit's immediate objective?** (Aggression, Retreat, Defense)
*   [ ] **If it encounters an enemy, should it engage?**
    *   Yes -> Use `.attack()`.
    *   No -> Use `.move()`.
*   [ ] **Should the unit hold its current position?**
    *   Yes, and fire if threatened -> Use `.hold_position()`.
    *   Yes, and do nothing -> Use `.stop()`.
