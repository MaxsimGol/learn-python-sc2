To issue actions effectively in `python-sc2`, it is essential to understand that there are two distinct architectural pathways for interacting with the StarCraft II engine, each optimized for a different purpose: **Commands** and **Queries**.

1.  **Commands** are non-blocking, "fire-and-forget" instructions that are buffered for performance.
2.  **Queries** are blocking requests that pause execution to wait for an immediate response from the game engine.

Mastering the distinction between these two pathways is the key to writing efficient, error-free bot code.

#### **Pathway 1- The Command Buffer (High Throughput)**

This is the default pathway for most actions. It is used when your code **tells** a unit to do something and does not require an immediate response to continue its logic.

*   **Examples:** `unit.attack()`, `unit.move()`, `structure.train()`, `worker.gather()`
*   **Mechanism:** When you call a command method like `marine.attack(target)`, the instruction is simply added to an internal action buffer. Your code's execution continues instantly. At the end of the `on_step` function, the library sends the entire buffer of collected commands to the game in a single, highly-optimized batch.
*   **The Rule:** Because you are not waiting for a result, you **do not** use `await` for simple commands.

#### **Pathway 2- The Awaited Query (Low Latency)**

This pathway is used only when your code **asks** the game for a piece of information that it needs *right now* to make a subsequent decision.

*   **Examples:** `self.find_placement(...)`, `self.expand_now()`, `self.get_available_abilities(...)`
*   **Mechanism:**
    1.  Your code reaches a line like `pylon_location = await self.find_placement(...)`.
    2.  The `await` keyword **pauses your `on_step` function** at that line.
    3.  A query is sent to the game engine, and control is yielded to the main `asyncio` event loop.
    4.  When the engine's response arrives, the event loop **resumes your `on_step` function** at the exact point it paused, now with the query's result available.
*   **The Rule:** Because you are explicitly waiting for a response, you **must** use `await` for queries.

#### **A Comparison of Interaction Types**

| Interaction Type | Analogy | Primary Use Case | `await` Required? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Command** | Adding an item to a shopping cart. You add many items, then "check out" once at the end. | **Telling** units to perform actions (`attack`, `move`). | **No** |
| **Query** | Making a synchronous API request. Your code blocks until the server's JSON response is received. | **Asking** the game for information (`find_placement`). | **Yes** |

#### **Visualizing the `on_step` Execution Flow**

```python
async def on_step(self, iteration: int):
    # --- Start of on_step execution ---

    # PATHWAY 1: COMMAND (Non-blocking)
    # Adds an 'attack' command to the internal buffer. Execution is instantaneous.
    self.units(UnitTypeId.MARINE).attack(target)

    # ... other non-blocking code can execute here ...

    # PATHWAY 2: QUERY (Blocking within this function)
    # The 'await' keyword PAUSES on_step execution here.
    pylon_location = await self.find_placement(UnitTypeId.PYLON, near=self.start_location)
    
    # <--- Time passes. The event loop runs. The game engine responds. --->
    
    # RESUME: Execution of on_step RESUMES from this point with the result.
    if pylon_location:
        # PATHWAY 1: COMMAND (Non-blocking)
        # Adds a 'build' command to the same buffer.
        self.build(UnitTypeId.PYLON, pylon_location)

    # --- End of on_step execution ---
    # NOW, the library sends the entire action buffer (containing both the
    # 'attack' and 'build' commands) to the game engine in one batch.
```

#### **Architectural Justification**

This dual-pathway system is a deliberate engineering design choice that optimizes for two different goals:

1.  **Commands optimize for throughput.** By batching many commands together, the system can handle a very high volume of actions per second with minimal network overhead.
2.  **Queries optimize for latency.** By pausing execution to wait for a response, the system ensures that your bot has the most up-to-date information possible before making a critical, data-dependent decision.

The guiding principle is simple: **"Tell, don't ask, unless you must."** This ensures your bot is both fast and intelligent.
