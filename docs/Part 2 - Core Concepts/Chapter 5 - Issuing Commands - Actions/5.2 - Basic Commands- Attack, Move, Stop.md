### **5.2. Basic Commands: Attack, Move, and Stop**

These four commands are the fundamental verbs of StarCraft II. They form the basis of all unit control, from simple army movements to complex micro-management. Every command is a method on a `Unit` object and, because it's a network action, must be `await`ed or batched with `self.do_actions()`.

#### **A Tactical Comparison of Core Commands**

Choosing the right command depends entirely on your tactical goal.

| Command | `unit.attack(target)` | `unit.move(target)` | `unit.stop()` | `unit.hold_position()` |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tactical Role** | **Offensive.** Engages targets and pursues them. | **Repositioning.** Moves safely from A to B. | **Full Stop.** Cancels all actions. | **Defensive.** Holds a position and fires on enemies in range. |
| **Engages Enemies?** | **Yes.** Automatically fights any enemies encountered. | **No.** Will ignore enemies and continue to its destination. | **No.** Will not auto-acquire targets. | **Yes.** Will fire on enemies in range but will not chase them. |
| **Target Type** | `Unit` or `Point2` | `Point2` only | None | None |
| **Primary Use Case**| **Attack-Moving an army.** Standard way to advance on the enemy. | Retreating damaged units or moving workers. | Arranging units precisely for an ambush or spell. | Setting up a defensive line at a chokepoint. |

#### **Command Deep Dive**

**1. The `attack` Command**
This is your primary tool for aggression.

*   `await unit.attack(enemy_unit)`: The unit will hunt down and attack a specific enemy.
*   `await unit.attack(map_location)`: The unit will **attack-move**. This is the most common command for an army. It moves towards a location and automatically fights any hostiles it meets along the way.

**2. The `move` Command**
This is for pure, uninterruptible movement.

*   `await unit.move(map_location)`: The unit will travel to the location, ignoring all distractions. If it takes damage, it will not retaliate. This is essential for retreating.

**3. The `stop` and `hold_position` Commands**
These are for static positioning.

*   `await unit.stop()`: Cancels the unit's current order. It will stand still and do nothing.
*   `await unit.hold_position()`: The superior defensive command. The unit stands still but will fire on any enemies that enter its weapon range, making it perfect for defending a ramp.

#### **A Developer's Tactical Checklist**

When controlling a unit, ask yourself:

-   [ ] **What is my goal?** (Aggression, Retreat, Defense)
-   [ ] **Should this unit fight if it meets an enemy?**
    -   Yes -> Use `attack`.
    -   No -> Use `move`.
-   [ ] **Should this unit hold its ground?**
    -   Yes, and fire back -> Use `hold_position`.
    -   Yes, and do nothing -> Use `stop`.

#### **Code Example: The Tactical Officer Bot**

This bot demonstrates making tactical decisions for its army. It will send its main force to attack-move, but if any unit becomes heavily damaged, it will be ordered to `move` back to a safe location.
