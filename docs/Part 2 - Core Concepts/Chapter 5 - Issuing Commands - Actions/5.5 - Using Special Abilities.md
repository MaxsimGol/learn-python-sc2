Beyond basic commands, many units have powerful abilities that define high-level strategyâ€”a Sentry's Force Field, a Ghost's Snipe, or a Queen's Inject Larva. The library provides a direct and intuitive syntax for using these abilities by making the `Unit` object itself "callable."

#### **The Callable Unit: A Unified Syntax**

The core method for using any ability is to treat the `Unit` object as if it were a function. This is a simple, non-blocking **Command** and should not be awaited.

*   **Syntax:** `unit(ability_id, target=None, queue=False)`
*   **Behavior:** This call creates a `UnitCommand` object and adds it to the internal action buffer. The library sends all buffered commands at the end of the `on_step` execution.
*   **Parameters:**
    *   **`ability_id`**: The `AbilityId` of the action you want to perform.
    *   **`target`** (optional): A `Unit` or `Point2` for targeted abilities.
    *   **`queue`** (optional `bool`): Controls whether the command replaces the unit's current action or is added to its command queue.

#### **Deep Dive 1- The `queue` Parameter**

The `queue` parameter is how you chain commands together for a single unit, mimicking the "Shift-click" functionality in the game.

| Value | Behavior | Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`queue=False`** (Default) | **Replace Current Action.** The unit's command queue is cleared. It immediately stops what it's doing and executes this new command. | For actions that need to happen *right now*, like casting a critical spell or retreating a low-health unit. |
| **`queue=True`** | **Add to Queue.** The command is added to the end of the unit's existing command queue. The unit will finish its current task(s) before starting this new one. | For creating a sequence of actions, such as telling a worker to build three Supply Depots in a row, or telling a scout to visit multiple locations. |

**Code Example: Queuing Worker Commands**
```python
async def on_step(self, iteration: int):
    # On the first step, give a worker a sequence of tasks.
    if iteration == 0 and self.workers.exists:
        worker = self.workers.first
        
        # Find a build location and a mineral patch.
        depot_location = await self.find_placement(UnitTypeId.SUPPLYDEPOT, near=self.start_location, placement_step=5)
        mineral_patch = self.mineral_field.closest_to(worker)

        if depot_location and mineral_patch:
            # Task 1: Build the depot (immediate action).
            worker.build(UnitTypeId.SUPPLYDEPOT, depot_location)

            # Task 2: After the depot is finished, start mining.
            # queue=True ensures this happens *after* the build command.
            worker.gather(mineral_patch, queue=True)
```

#### **Deep Dive 2- `self.get_available_abilities()`**

Just checking a unit's energy is not enough. An ability might be on cooldown. **`await self.get_available_abilities(unit)`** is the only reliable way to check. This is an `async` **Query** that asks the game engine for a list of every `AbilityId` a specific unit can use on the current game tick.

---

#### **The Professional Ability Workflow**

A professional bot follows a strict, four-step workflow to ensure every ability command is valid.

```
(You want to use an ability...)
         |
         v
.--- 1. SELECT CASTER ---.
| `queens = self.units(QUEEN)` |
`------------------------`
         |
         v
.--- 2. CHECK PREREQUISITES ---.
| - `queen.energy >= 25`         |
| - `await self.get_available_abilities(queen)` |  <-- This is a QUERY
`------------------------------`
         | (Checks pass)
         v
.--- 3. FIND VALID TARGET ---.
| `target = self.townhalls.closest_to(queen)` |
`---------------------------`
         | (Target found)
         v
.---- 4. ISSUE COMMAND ----.
| `queen(AbilityId.EFFECT_INJECTLARVA, target)` | <-- This is a COMMAND
`-------------------------`
```

#### **Code Example- The Zerg Matriarch Bot**

This bot demonstrates the complete workflow for using a Queen's inject ability. It uses `await` for the `get_available_abilities` query but correctly issues the final `queen(...)` command without `await`.
