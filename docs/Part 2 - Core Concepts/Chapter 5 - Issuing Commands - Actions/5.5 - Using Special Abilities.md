Beyond basic commands, many units have powerful abilities that define high-level strategyâ€”a Sentry's Force Field, a Ghost's Snipe, or a Queen's Inject Larva. The library provides a direct and intuitive syntax for using these abilities by making the `Unit` object itself "callable."

#### **The Callable Unit: A Unified Syntax**

The core method for using any ability is to treat the `Unit` object as a function.

*   **Syntax:** `unit(ability_id, target, queue)`
*   **What it returns:** A `UnitCommand` object. This means it must be executed with `self.do()` (e.g., `await self.do(unit(...))`).

This unified syntax handles all types of abilities.

| Target Type | Example | Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **No Target** | `marine(AbilityId.EFFECT_STIMPACK)` | Self-cast abilities like Stimpack or a Medivac's Heal. |
| **Unit Target**| `ghost(AbilityId.SNIPEDOT_SNIPE, target_ultralisk)` | Abilities that must be cast on another unit. |
| **Point Target**| `sentry(AbilityId.FORCEFIELD_FORCEFIELD, location)` | Abilities that are cast on a specific point on the ground. |

#### **The Professional Ability Workflow**

Issuing an ability command blindly will lead to errors. A professional bot follows a strict, four-step workflow to ensure the command is valid and will succeed.

```
(You want to use an ability...)
         |
         v
.--- 1. SELECT CASTER ---------.
| `queens = self.units(QUEEN)` |
`------------------------------`
         |
         v
.--- 2. CHECK PREREQUISITES --------------------.
| - `queen.energy >= 25`                        |
| - `await self.get_available_abilities(queen)` |
`-----------------------------------------------`
         | (Checks pass)
         v
.--- 3. FIND VALID TARGET --------------------.
| `target = self.townhalls.closest_to(queen)` |
`---------------------------------------------`
         | (Target found)
         v
.---- 4. ISSUE COMMAND ----------------------------------------.
| `await self.do(queen(AbilityId.EFFECT_INJECTLARVA, target))` |
`--------------------------------------------------------------`
```

#### **Step 2 Deep Dive: `self.get_available_abilities()`**

Just checking a unit's energy (`unit.energy`) is a common beginner mistake. An ability might have enough energy but still be on cooldown.

**`await self.get_available_abilities(unit)`** is the only reliable way to check. This `async` function queries the game and returns a list of every `AbilityId` that a specific unit can use on the current game tick.

**Rule of Thumb:** Before casting any ability with a cooldown, you **must** check if its `AbilityId` is present in the list returned by this function.

#### **Developer's Checklist for Using an Ability**

Before writing your code, follow this plan:

-   [ ] **1. Identify the Caster:** Get a `Units` collection of the units that can cast the spell.
-   [ ] **2. Check Resources:** Filter the collection for units with enough energy.
-   [ ] **3. Check Cooldown:** In a loop, use `await self.get_available_abilities()` for each potential caster to see if the ability is ready.
-   [ ] **4. Find a Target:** If the ability is targeted, find a suitable `Unit` or `Point2`.
-   [ ] **5. Issue the Command:** Use `await self.do(unit(ABILITY_ID, target))` to execute the action.

**Pro Tip:** To find the `AbilityId` for a specific action, you can explore the `burnysc2.ids.ability_id` file in the library's source code, or use a tool like the StarCraft II Data Dumper.

#### **Code Example: The Zerg Matriarch Bot**

This bot demonstrates the complete, professional workflow for using a Queen's "Inject Larva" ability. Each step in the code directly corresponds to a step in the workflow diagram.
