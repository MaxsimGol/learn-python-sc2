Worker units are the engine of your economy and the architects of your base. They have two primary, specialized commands: `gather` for harvesting resources and `build` for constructing structures. While gathering is a simple "fire-and-forget" command, building requires a more deliberate, multi-step process.

---

#### **The `gather` Command: Your Economic Engine**

The `gather` command is the simplest and most fundamental worker action.

*   **Signature:** `worker.gather(target)`
*   **Target:** A `Unit` object that is a `MineralField` or `VespeneGeyser`.
*   **Behavior:** The worker will travel to the resource, harvest it, return it to the nearest townhall, and **continue this loop indefinitely.** You only need to issue this command once per worker.

```python
# A common pattern: find idle workers and put them to work.
for worker in self.workers.idle:
    # Find the closest mineral patch to this specific worker.
    closest_mineral_patch = self.mineral_field.closest_to(worker)
    # Issue the gather command.
    self.do(worker.gather(closest_mineral_patch))
```

---

#### **The Build Request Lifecycle**

Constructing a building is not a single command but a workflow. You must first ask the game for a valid location before you can command a worker to build there.

```
(You decide to build a Pylon)
          |
          v
.---- CAN I BUILD? -------------.
| - self.can_afford()           |
| - self.already_pending() == 0 |
`-------------------------------`
          | (Yes)
          v
.---- WHERE TO BUILD? -------------------.
| location = await self.find_placement() |
`----------------------------------------`
          | (Location is valid)
          v
.---- ISSUE COMMAND ----------------.
| await self.build(PYLON, location) |
`-----------------------------------`
          |
          v
(Worker begins construction)
```

This lifecycle prevents errors and ensures your bot doesn't try to build in illegal locations or waste resources on redundant structures.

#### **Key Functions for Building**

| Function | Signature | Role in the Lifecycle |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`self.can_afford(unit_id)`** | `(UnitTypeId) -> bool` | **Condition Check.** Returns `True` if you have enough minerals and gas for a given unit or structure. |
| **`self.already_pending(unit_id)`**| `(UnitTypeId) -> int` or `float` | **Condition Check.** Returns the number of a given unit/structure type currently in production. Essential for avoiding duplicates. |
| **`self.find_placement(...)`** | `(UnitTypeId, near, ...) -> Point2 or None` | **Location Finding.** Asks the game for a valid build spot. This is an `async` function and must be awaited. |
| **`self.build(...)`** | `(UnitTypeId, near_or_location) -> UnitCommand`| **Action Issuing.** The high-level helper that finds a worker and issues the final build command. This is also `async`. |

#### **Deep Dive: `self.find_placement()`**

This is a powerful but potentially slow function. Understanding its parameters is key to using it effectively.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `building` | `UnitTypeId` | **Required.** The specific building you want to place (e.g., `UnitTypeId.PYLON`). |
| `near` | `Point2` | **Required.** The center point of the search area. |
| `max_distance` | `int` | The maximum radius to search from the `near` point. Defaults to 20. |
| `placement_step`| `int` | The grid size of the search. A higher value (e.g., 5) is faster but less precise. A lower value (e.g., 1) is slower but will find tighter spots. Defaults to 2. |

#### **Code Example: The Architect Bot**

This bot demonstrates a robust and scalable building system. Instead of reacting instantly, it uses a simple list as a "build queue" to manage its construction projects, tackling one at a time.

```python
# architect_bot.py

from collections import deque
from sc2 import maps
from sc2.bot_ai import BotAI
from sc2.data import Difficulty, Race
from sc2.main import run_game
from sc2.player import Bot, Computer
from sc2.ids.unit_typeid import UnitTypeId

class ArchitectBot(BotAI):
    """A bot that uses a build queue to manage construction projects."""
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        # Use a deque as a simple, efficient queue.
        self.build_queue = deque()

    async def on_step(self, iteration: int):
        await self.distribute_workers()
        self.update_build_queue()
        await self.execute_build_queue()

    def update_build_queue(self):
        """Adds required buildings to the queue."""
        # Queue a Supply Depot if we are running low on supply.
        if (
            self.supply_left < 5
            and self.already_pending(UnitTypeId.SUPPLYDEPOT) == 0
            and UnitTypeId.SUPPLYDEPOT not in self.build_queue
        ):
            self.build_queue.append(UnitTypeId.SUPPLYDEPOT)

        # Queue a Barracks if we have a depot but no barracks.
        if (
            self.structures(UnitTypeId.SUPPLYDEPOT).ready.exists
            and not self.structures(UnitTypeId.BARRACKS).exists
            and self.already_pending(UnitTypeId.BARRACKS) == 0
            and UnitTypeId.BARRACKS not in self.build_queue
        ):
            self.build_queue.append(UnitTypeId.BARRACKS)

    async def execute_build_queue(self):
        """Works on the first item in the build queue."""
        if not self.build_queue:
            return

        # Get the next building project from the front of the queue.
        building_to_construct = self.build_queue[0]

        # Check if we can afford the project.
        if self.can_afford(building_to_construct):
            # Find a location for the building.
            build_location = await self.find_placement(
                building_to_construct, near=self.start_location, placement_step=5
            )

            if build_location:
                # Issue the build command.
                await self.build(building_to_construct, build_location)
                # Remove the completed project from the queue.
                self.build_queue.popleft()
