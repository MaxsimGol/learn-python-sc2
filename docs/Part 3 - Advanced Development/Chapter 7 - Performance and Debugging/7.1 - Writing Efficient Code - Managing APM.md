As your bot's intelligence grows, so does the complexity of its code. Inefficient code is not just a matter of elegance; it can lead to critical performance issues, including game-losing lag and desync bugs. Writing efficient code is about making your bot both fast and stable.

A key symptom of inefficient code is abnormally high **APM (Actions Per Minute)**. While high APM is not a goal, an APM in the tens of thousands is a red flag that your bot is spamming redundant commands.

#### **The Performance Landscape**

Your bot's performance is a balance between the complexity of its logic and the time it has to execute it.

```
+------------------------------------+
|   Your Bot's Logic (on_step)       |
|------------------------------------|
| - Complex calculations             | <--- The more you do, the longer it takes.
| - Looping through many units       |
| - Issuing many commands            |
+------------------------------------+
                 |
                 v
+------------------------------------+
|   Real-world Time Limit per Step   | <--- The game engine will not wait for you.
|      (e.g., ~16ms for 60FPS)       |      If your code is too slow, you miss your turn.
+------------------------------------+
```
The goal is to fit all necessary logic within this time limit.

#### **Core Principles for Efficient Code**

| Principle | The Problem (Inefficient) | The Solution (Efficient) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Avoid Redundant Commands**| Telling a Marine that is already attacking to attack again. This is the #1 cause of high APM. | Only issue commands to units whose state needs to change (e.g., units that are `idle`). |
| **2. Batch Your Actions** | Using `await` for each action inside a loop. Each `await` can force a sequential execution within a single step. | Issue commands directly (e.g., `unit.attack(...)`). The library automatically collects all actions and sends them as a single batch at the end of the game step. |
| **3. Throttle Your Logic** | Checking for a new expansion or a high-level upgrade 60 times per second. This is unnecessary. | Use the `iteration` counter or `self.time` to run non-urgent logic less frequently (e.g., once every 5-10 seconds). |
| **4. Cache Expensive Calculations**| Re-calculating a complex value (like the perfect wall-off position) on every single game step. | Calculate the value once in `on_start` and store the result in a `self` variable (e.g., `self.wall_position`). |

#### **Developer's Checklist for Optimization**

Before finalizing a new piece of logic, review it with this checklist:

-   [ ] **Is this command necessary?** Am I only telling units to do something if they aren't already doing it? (Check `.is_idle`).
-   [ ] **Am I commanding a group?** If so, am I just issuing commands directly and letting the library batch them automatically?
-   [ ] **Does this need to run every step?** Could this logic be throttled to run every few seconds instead?
-   [ ] **Is this calculation complex?** If so, can I compute it once and cache the result?

#### **Code Example: The "Optimized" Bot**

This bot demonstrates all four principles of efficiency. It lets the library batch actions, commands only idle units, throttles its logging, and caches a key strategic position in `on_start`.

```python
# optimized_bot.py
