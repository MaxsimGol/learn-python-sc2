A bot can have flawless code but a flawed strategy. Identifying these strategic bugs requires a different approach than traditional debugging. Your primary tools are **controlled local testing**, **instrumented logging**, and most importantly, **systematic replay analysis**.

#### **The Debugging Workflow**

Effective debugging is a cycle of testing, observation, and refinement.

```
+--------------------------+
|  1. Run a Local Test     | <-- Control the variables (map, opponent).
|  (Generate Logs & Replay)|
+--------------------------+
           |
           v
+--------------------------+
|  2. Analyze the Replay   | <-- Watch the game from all perspectives.
|  (Cross-reference logs)  |
+--------------------------+
           |
           v
+--------------------------+
|  3. Identify a Flaw      | <-- "My army attacked into a bad position at 5:30."
|  (Form a hypothesis)     |
+--------------------------+
           |
           v
+--------------------------+
|  4. Modify the Code      | <-- "Add a check to retreat if the enemy
|  (Implement a fix)       |      army value is 20% higher."
+--------------------------+
           |
           '---------------------> (Repeat)
```

#### **1. Local Testing: Your Laboratory**

The `run_game` block is your testing environment. Use it to create specific, repeatable scenarios.

| Test Type | `run_game` Configuration | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Unit Test** | `realtime=False`, no opponent. | Quickly test a single mechanic (e.g., "Does my build order complete?"). |
| **Integration Test** | `realtime=True`, `Computer` opponent. | Test how your bot's systems work together against a predictable opponent. |
| **Strategy Test** | `realtime=True`, vs. another of your bots. | Pit specific strategies against each other to find counters and weaknesses. |

**Pro Tip:** To make your tests repeatable, you can set a `random_seed`. This ensures that "random" choices (like which worker to select) are the same every time you run the test.
```python
from sc2.main import run_game

run_game(..., random_seed=12345)
```

#### **2. Instrumented Logging: Your Bot's "Black Box"**

Your logs are the "black box recorder" of your bot's decisions. Good logs explain *why* an action was taken.

| Logging Best Practice | Inefficient Log (`print("Attacking")`) | Instrumented Log (Better) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Be Specific & Contextual**| `print("Building depot")` | `print(f"[{self.time_formatted}] Supply is {self.supply_used}/{self.supply_cap}. Building a depot.")` |
| **Log State Changes** | `print("Fighting")` | `print(f"[{self.time_formatted}] Army value: 1200, Enemy value: 800. Engaging.")` |
| **Throttle Your Logs** | Printing every step. | `if self.time - self.last_log_time > 5:` |

**Recommended Library: `loguru`**
The `burnysc2` library comes with `loguru` pre-installed. It provides colored, timestamped, and leveled logging with almost no setup, making it a professional replacement for `print()`.

```python
from loguru import logger

# In on_start:
logger.add("logs/my_bot_log.log", rotation="10 MB") # Automatically saves logs to a file.

# In on_step:
if self.supply_left < 5:
    logger.info(f"Supply low ({self.supply_left}), queuing a depot.")
```

#### **3. Replay Analysis: The Post-Mortem**

A replay is the ultimate ground truth. It shows you exactly what happened, free from your bot's flawed perception.

**Replay Analysis Checklist:**

-   [ ] **1. Save the Replay:**
    ```python
    from sc2.main import run_game

    run_game(..., save_replay_as="MyBot_vs_Rush.SC2Replay")
    ```
-   [ ] **2. Open StarCraft II:** Launch the game client manually and go to the "Replays" tab.
-   [ ] **3. Use Observer Tools Systematically:**
    -   [ ] **Watch from Your Bot's Perspective:** What did it see? Was its vision limited?
    -   [ ] **Watch from the Enemy's Perspective:** How did they react to you? Did they scout your strategy?
    -   [ ] **Watch with Full Vision:** See the "perfect information" view. Where could your bot have made a better decision if it had scouted?
-   [ ] **4. Cross-Reference with Logs:** Have your log file open. If the log says "Engaging enemy at 5:30," jump to that timestamp in the replay. Did the engagement happen as your bot intended?

**Key Questions to Ask During Analysis:**

-   **Economy:** Are my workers ever idle? Is my money high while my production is not queued?
-   **Strategy:** Did I expand at the right time? Did I build the correct counter-units?
-   **Tactics:** Did my army get caught in a bad position? Did I focus fire the wrong targets?

By treating debugging as a scientific process of forming a hypothesis, running a controlled test, and analyzing the results, you can systematically improve both the code and the strategic intelligence of your bot.
