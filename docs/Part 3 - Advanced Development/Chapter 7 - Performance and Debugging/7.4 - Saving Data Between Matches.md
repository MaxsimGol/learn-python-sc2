For a bot to learn, adapt, and improve over time, it must have a memory. It needs a way to store information from one match and retrieve it in the next. This capability, known as **persistence**, is the foundation of any learning AI.

While `python-sc2` does not provide a built-in database, it fully supports standard Python file operations, allowing you to easily read and write data to your local disk.

#### **The Persistence Lifecycle: Read, Update, Write**

The process of managing persistent data follows a simple, three-stage lifecycle that mirrors your bot's own.

```
+--------------------------+
|  1. Read on Start        | <-- In on_start(), load data from a file
|  (Load Knowledge)        |     into a `self` variable.
+--------------------------+
           |
           v
+--------------------------+
|  2. Update in `on_step`  | <-- As the game progresses, modify the
|  (Gain Experience)       |     data in the `self` variable.
+--------------------------+
           |
           v
+--------------------------+
|  3. Write on End         | <-- In on_end(), save the updated `self`
|  (Record Knowledge)      |     variable back to the file.
+--------------------------+
```
By following this pattern, your bot creates a feedback loop, where the outcome of each game informs its strategy for the next.

#### **Choosing Your Data Format: `json` vs. `pickle`**

You have two primary choices for how to format your data on disk. Your choice depends on the complexity of the data you need to store.

| Aspect | `json` (JavaScript Object Notation) | `pickle` (Python Specific) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Format** | Human-readable text. | Binary, not human-readable. |
| **Use Case** | **Recommended for most bots.** Ideal for simple, structured data like dictionaries, lists, and numbers. | For storing complex, custom Python objects or class instances that `json` cannot handle. |
| **Pros** | - Easy to open and debug by hand.<br />- Language-agnostic. | - Can serialize almost any Python object. |
| **Cons** | - Limited to simple data types. | - Can be a security risk if loading files from an untrusted source.<br />- Tied to a specific Python version. |

**The Professional Recommendation:** Start with `json`. Its readability makes debugging far easier. Only move to `pickle` if you have a specific, complex object that `json` cannot represent.

#### **A Developer's Checklist for Persistence**

-   [ ] **1. Define Your Data Structure:** What information do I need to save? (e.g., a dictionary of strategies with win/loss counts).
-   [ ] **2. Encapsulate File Logic:** Create a helper class or functions to handle reading and writing. This keeps your main bot class clean.
-   [ ] **3. Implement the `on_start` Hook:** Load the data from the file into a `self` variable. Handle the case where the file doesn't exist yet.
-   [ ] **4. Implement the `on_end` Hook:** Save the updated `self` variable back to the file.

#### **Code Example: The "Adaptive" Bot with an Encapsulated Knowledge Base**

This bot demonstrates a professional approach to persistence. It uses a dedicated `KnowledgeBase` class to manage all file I/O for its `data.json` file. The bot uses this knowledge to choose the strategy with the best historical win rate, and updates the file with the result of each match.

**To see this bot learn, you must run the script multiple times.**
