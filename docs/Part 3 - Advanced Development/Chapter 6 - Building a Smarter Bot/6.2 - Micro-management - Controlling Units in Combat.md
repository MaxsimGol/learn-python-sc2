If macro-management is about building a bigger army, micro-management ("micro") is about making that army fight smarter. It is the fine-grained, real-time control of individual units in combat to maximize their value, minimize losses, and ultimately win battles against superior numbers.

Effective micro is the difference between a clumsy mob of units and a coordinated, intelligent fighting force. It is where a bot's "skill" truly shines.

#### **The Micro-management System**

Micro logic is a continuous, rapid decision-making loop that runs for each unit during combat.

```
(For each unit in a fight...)
          |
          v
.---- 1. ASSESS THREAT --------.
| - Who is the biggest danger? |
| - Am I in a bad position?    |
`------------------------------`
          |
          v
.--- 2. ASSESS SELF ----.
| - Is my health low?   |
| - Is my weapon ready? |
`-----------------------`
          |
          v
.---- 3. DECIDE & ACT --------.
| - Retreat?                  |
| - Reposition?               |
| - Attack a priority target? |
`-----------------------------`
```
This loop runs inside your `on_step` method, evaluating the state of each unit and issuing precise commands to optimize its performance.

#### **Core Micro Techniques: A Tactical Overview**

| Technique | Goal | How It Works | Key `python-sc2` Tool |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Focus Firing** | **Eliminate threats quickly.** | Command all your units to attack the same high-value enemy target (e.g., a Siege Tank or High Templar). | `Units.closest_to()`<br />`army.attack(target)` |
| **Kiting (Stutter-Step)** | **Maximize damage, minimize risk.** | For ranged units: move away from the enemy while your weapon is on cooldown, then stop to fire as soon as it's ready. | `unit.weapon_cooldown` |
| **Retreating Damaged Units** | **Preserve your army.** | Pull individual, low-health units out of the fight to save them for later. A surviving unit is better than a dead one. | `unit.health_percentage`<br />`unit.move(safe_location)` |
| **Splitting** | **Mitigate splash damage.** | Move units away from each other to reduce the number hit by a single enemy area-of-effect attack (e.g., from a Baneling). | `unit.move()` |

#### **A Developer's Checklist for Micro Logic**

When implementing micro for a group of units, this is your plan:

-   [ ] **1. Define a Threat.** Identify what constitutes a "dangerous" situation (e.g., enemy units are within a certain range).
-   [ ] **2. Select a Priority Target.** Find the single most important enemy unit for the entire group to focus on.
-   [ ] **3. Loop Through Your Units.** For each unit in your army:
    -   [ ] Check its individual condition (health, cooldowns).
    -   [ ] **Issue Commands Directly.** Decide on its best action (attack the priority target, retreat, or reposition) and call the appropriate method (e.g., `unit.attack(target)`). The library will automatically queue and execute these at the end of the step.

#### **Code Example: The "Skirmisher" Bot**

This bot demonstrates two fundamental micro techniques: **focus firing** and **retreating damaged units**. It builds a force of Marines and, when it engages the enemy, it will intelligently focus fire and pull back weakened units to preserve its army.

```python
# skirmisher_bot.py

from sc2 import maps
from sc2.bot_ai import BotAI
from sc2.data import Difficulty, Race
from sc2.main import run_game
from sc2.player import Bot, Computer
from sc2.ids.unit_typeid import UnitTypeId
from sc2.units import Units

class SkirmisherBot(BotAI):
    """A bot that demonstrates focus firing and retreating damaged units."""

    async def on_step(self, iteration: int):
        # We need an army to command.
        await self.build_army()

        army: Units = self.units(UnitTypeId.MARINE)
        if not army.exists:
            return

        # If there are no enemies, attack-move towards their base.
        if not self.enemy_units.exists:
            for unit in army.idle:
                unit.attack(self.enemy_start_locations[0])
            return

        # --- Micro Logic Begins ---
        # 1. Select a Priority Target for the entire army.
        # We'll target the enemy unit with the lowest health to eliminate it quickly.
        priority_target = self.enemy_units.sorted(lambda u: u.health).first

        # 2. Define a safe retreat position.
        retreat_position = self.start_location.towards(self.game_info.map_center, 15)

        # 3. Loop through our units and issue a command for each.
        for marine in army:
            # If the marine is badly damaged, retreat it.
            if marine.health_percentage < 0.4:
                marine.move(retreat_position)
            # Otherwise, command it to attack the priority target.
            else:
                marine.attack(priority_target)


    async def build_army(self):
        """A simple helper method to produce units for the demo."""
        if self.supply_left < 2 and not self.already_pending(UnitTypeId.SUPPLYDEPOT):
            if self.can_afford(UnitTypeId.SUPPLYDEPOT):
                await self.build(UnitTypeId.SUPPLYDEPOT, near=self.start_location.towards(self.game_info.map_center, 5))

        if not self.structures(UnitTypeId.BARRACKS).exists and not self.already_pending(UnitTypeId.BARRACKS):
            if self.can_afford(UnitTypeId.BARRACKS):
                await self.build(UnitTypeId.BARRACKS, near=self.start_location.towards(self.game_info.map_center, 8))

        if self.structures(UnitTypeId.BARRACKS).ready.idle.exists and self.can_afford(UnitTypeId.MARINE):
            self.train(UnitTypeId.MARINE)
