Your bot's standard senses (`self.state` and its helpers) provide a snapshot of what *is*. But to make truly intelligent decisions, your bot needs to ask what *could be*. Can a unit get from A to B? Is an ability actually ready to use? Answering these questions requires **querying** the game engine for a specific calculation.

Queries are `async` functions that send a request to the StarCraft II engine and `await` a response. They are essential tools for moving beyond simple reactive logic to proactive, error-proof planning.

#### **The Query System**

Think of a query as a direct question to the game engine's internal rulebook.

```
+------------------+
|                  |   1. "Can a Marine walk from my base to this island?"
|  Your Python Bot | --------------------------------------------------> +---------------+
|   (The Querier)  |                                                     |               |
|                  |   2. "No, the path distance is None."               |  SC2 Game     |
|                  | <-------------------------------------------------- |   Engine      |
+------------------+                                                     |  (The Oracle) |
                                                                         +---------------+
```
This request-response cycle allows your bot to validate its plans before committing resources.

#### **The Three Essential Queries**

| Query | Key Function | What It Asks | When to Use It |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Placement** | `await self.find_placement(...)` | "Where is a valid spot to build this structure?" | **Always.** Before every `self.build` command to ensure the location is legal. |
| **Pathing** | `await self.client.query_pathing(...)` | "Is there a walkable ground path from point A to point B?" | Before sending a ground unit to a distant location, especially a potential expansion, to avoid "island" traps. |
| **Ability** | `await self.get_available_abilities(...)` | "Which abilities can this specific unit use *right now*?" | **Always.** Before casting any ability with a cooldown to ensure it's not on cooldown. This is more reliable than just checking energy. |

#### **A Developer's Checklist for Using Queries**

-   [ ] **1. Identify the Question:** What do I need to know before I act? (e.g., "Is this expansion on an island?")
-   [ ] **2. Choose the Right Query:** Select the function that answers your question (`query_pathing`, `get_available_abilities`, etc.).
-   [ ] **3. `await` the Response:** Since queries are network requests, you must `await` the result.
-   [ ] **4. Handle the Response:** The query might return `None` or an empty list if the answer is negative. Your code must handle this gracefully.
    -   `if path_distance is None:`
    -   `if AbilityId.STIMPACK in available_abilities:`
-   [ ] **5. Act on the Verified Information:** Only issue your command *after* the query has confirmed it's a valid action.

#### **Code Example: The "Inquisitive" Bot**

This bot demonstrates how to use queries to make its decisions more robust. It will use a **pathing query** to verify that its next expansion is reachable and an **ability query** to ensure its Stimpack command is valid.
