Macro-management ("macro") is the art of economy. It is a high-level, strategic process focused on resource collection, base expansion, and infrastructure development. A bot with superior macro can often defeat a bot with superior unit control ("micro") simply by producing a larger, better-equipped army.

This section moves beyond individual commands and into the realm of building a robust economic engine that will power your bot's war machine.

#### **The Macro Engine: A System of Priorities**

A strong macro bot doesn't just perform actions; it manages a system of competing priorities. At any given moment, it must decide what is the most important use of its resources.

```
+---------------------------------+
|      Incoming Resources         | (Minerals & Vespene)
| (self.minerals, self.vespene)   |
+---------------------------------+
                 |
                 v
+---------------------------------+
|     The Macro Engine (Your Bot) |
|---------------------------------|
| #1: Manage Supply               | <-- Top Priority: Never get supply blocked.
| #2: Produce Workers             | <-- The foundation of your economy.
| #3: Expand to New Bases         | <-- Increases your income ceiling.
| #4: Build Production/Tech       | <-- Unlocks new units and upgrades.
| #5: Build Army Units            | <-- Your win condition.
+---------------------------------+
```
Your `on_step` method should be structured to reflect this hierarchy, ensuring that critical economic tasks are always handled before less urgent ones.

#### **The Three Pillars of Economic Management**

| Pillar | Core Principle | Implementation Checklist |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Resource Velocity** | **Keep your money moving.** A large bank of unspent resources is a sign of inefficiency. Your goal is to have a high rate of spending. | `[ ]` Is my production always queued?<br />`[ ]` Am I building tech as soon as I can afford it?<br />`[ ]` Are my resources consistently low? |
| **2. Worker Saturation** | **Build workers constantly, and assign them correctly.** The goal is to "saturate" each base with the optimal number of workers. | `[ ]` Am I training workers from all idle townhalls?<br />`[ ]` Do I stop at a target worker count (e.g., 66-70)?<br />`[ ]` Are my vespene geysers fully staffed (3 workers each)? |
| **3. Base Expansion** | **Secure more income.** To build a larger army, you must expand to new mineral lines. | `[ ]` Do I have a clear trigger for when to expand? (e.g., at a certain time, supply, or tech level).<br />`[ ]` Am I using `self.expand_now()` for easy, reliable expansion? |

#### **Code Architecture: Separating Concerns**

As your bot's logic grows, a single, massive `on_step` method becomes unmanageable. A professional approach is to separate concerns into different classes or methods. Here, we'll create a `MacroManager` to handle all economic decisions.

#### **Code Example: The "Economic Engine" Bot**

This bot demonstrates a clean, structured approach to macro. It uses a dedicated `MacroManager` class to handle its economy, following a strict priority list to ensure it grows efficiently and robustly.
