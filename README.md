## Table of Contents

This guide is structured to take a developer from a complete beginner to being capable of building advanced, learning-based agents.

*   **Part 1 - Getting Started**
    *   Introduction to `python-sc2`, installation, and running your first bot.

*   **Part 2 - Core Concepts**
    *   Understanding the `BotAI` class, reading the game state, and issuing commands.

*   **Part 3 - Advanced Development**
    *   Implementing macro and micro-management, debugging, and saving data between matches.

*   **Part 4 - The Wider World**
    *   Understanding the SC2 API's advantages and limitations, and engaging with the community.

*   **Part 5 - Reinforcement Learning**
    *   **Foundations of Reinforcement Learning:** A complete, practical introduction to using `stable-baselines3` with `python-sc2`, including three full bot implementations (Worker, Macro, Micro).
    *   **Advanced RL and Next Steps:** Implementing advanced techniques like Action Masking and Curriculum Learning, and a look at research-grade architectures like DRL-RM.

## Who Is This For?

*   **Beginners** new to StarCraft II AI who need a structured, step-by-step guide.
*   **Intermediate developers** who know the basics but want to learn professional patterns for managing complex bots.
*   **Reinforcement Learning practitioners** who want a practical guide to applying libraries like `stable-baselines3` to a complex game environment like StarCraft II.
