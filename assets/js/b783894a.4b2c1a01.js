Once you have a trained agent saved to a file, you need a way to load and run it for evaluation, a process known as inference. This allows you to watch your agent perform, test its capabilities against specific opponents, and verify its learned policy without the overhead of retraining.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}}')}}]);
